  what targets still remain to be hit    1.0
 these crucial questions  must be answered by post attack reconnaissance    1.0
  samos will  be hard put to see through clouds  and to see in the dark    1.0
  even if this is some day possible    1.0
 there remains the 30 minute time  of flight of a missile to its overseas target    1.0
 if the target can change  its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in  the air on its way    1.0
 the probability of the missile destroying the target  is drastically reduced    1.0
    pre  attack reconnaissance is vital  but only  post  attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate  the war favorably    1.0
 it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather  that post attack reconnaissance    1.0
 it could operate under the clouds  and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night    1.0
  it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately  destroy any targets it discovered  no need to wait for a missile  to come all the way from the united states with the chance that  the target    1.0
  such as the  b 52 or  b 70    1.0
 could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small  nuclear weapons    1.0
 few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive  power will create 1    1.0
000  psi overpressure at 100 feet    4.5305975793988527e+33
 the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed  by placing a one kiloton warhead  1 20th the size of those used in hiroshima  and nagasaki  within 100 to 200 feet of the target    462.3139359588979
  it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large  yield nuclear weapons    1.0
   today we have side looking radar which  has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual  buildings    1.0
  with these keen  eyes  and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy    1.0
  military forces can be directly attacked  with minimum damage  to urban areas     1.0
   if we fail to develop the means to hunt down  and destroy the enemymilitary force with extreme care and precision    1.0
  and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace    1.0
  our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening    1.0
  the lyric beauties of schubert trout  quintet   its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies  make it a source  of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners    136.73493642424344
 but for students of  musical forms and would be classifiers    1.0
 the work presents its problems    1.0
  since it requires only five players    1.0
 it would seem to fall into the  category of chamber music  yet it calls for a double bass    1.0
 an instrument  generally regarded as symphonic    1.0
 the piece is written  in five movements    1.0
 rather than the conventional four of most quintets    1.0
  and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor    1.0
   the  many and frequent performances of the  trout  serve to emphasize  the dual nature of its writing    1474.187087745661
 some renditions are of symphonic dimensions    1.0
  with the contrabass given free rein    1.0
 other interpretations present  the music as an essentially intimate creation    1.0
  the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background    1.0
 or it  is dressed in clownattire  the musical equivalent of a bull in  a china shop    1.0
 recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches    1.0
  when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer  than ten different performances    1.0
 the occasion for this marathon    1.0
  angellong awaited reissue in its  great recordings of the  century  series of the schnabel pro arte version    1.0
 let me say at  the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as  it did on the first    1.0
   whether considered alone or in relation  to other editions    1.0
  colh 40 is a document of prime importance    1.0
  artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert beethoven mozart  players of all time    1.0
 and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable    1.0
  but schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great  performer    1.0
 and the fact that four of the ten versions i listened to  are by schnabel pupils  clifford curzon    1.0
  and victor babin  also sheds light on the masterpedagogical  skills    1.0
 certain pianistic traits are common to all five schnabelian  renditions    331596448.38490283
 most notably the  schnabel trill   which differs  from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously     74881379234.65761
  but the most impressive testimony to schnabeldistinction  as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each  studentapproach as distinctly his own    1.0
 and impetuous  intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one    1.0
 yet no  detail was too small to receive attention from this master    1.0
 and as a  result the playing here has humor    1.0
 this  is a serious minded interpretation    1.0
 but it is never strait laced    1.0
 it is meticulously  faithful to schubertdynamic markings and phrase indications    1.0
  the piano performance on this  trout  is one that really demands  a search for superlatives    1.0
 rather regret that schnabel didn t  collaborate with the budapest quartet    344621841471204.0
 athletic  playing was a good deal closer to this pianistinterpretative outlook  than the style of the belgian group    1.0
  the string playing is good    1.0
 but the pro arte people fail to enter  into the spirit of things here    1.0
 is very  indulgent with swoops and slides    1.0
 and his tone is pinched and edgy    1.0
  the twenty five year old recording offers rather faded string tone    1.0
  but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very  quiet    1.0
 there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation  in the   forellen   movement    1.0
 and i suspect that this is  due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original  sps    1838.6996769257064
  turning to the more modern versions    1.0
 curzon london  offers  the most sophisticated keyboard work    1.0
 every detail in his interpretation  has been beautifully thought out    1.0
 and of these i would especially  cite the delicious  la ndler  touch the pianist brings to the fifth  variation  an obvious indication that he is playing with viennese  musicians     1.0
 and the gossamer shading throughout    1.0
 some of curzon playing strikes me as finicky    1.0
 does he favor   two  tempos    1.0
 the assisting  musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in  expertise     135912.6769836413
  but their contribution is rustic and appealing    1.0
  special compliments  to the double bass playing of johann krumpp    1.0
  tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance    1.0
   the glazer fine arts edition  concert disc  is a model of lucidity  and organization    1.0
 a perfectly integrated ensemble  effort    1.0
 but having lived with the disc for some time now    1.0
 i find  the performance less exciting than either schnabelor fleisher  whose superb performance with the budapest quartet has still to  be recorded  and a good deal less filled with humor than curzon s    34.30189142753036
  aeschbacherwork is very much akin to schnabel s    1.0
 but the sound  on his decca disc is dated    1.0
 and you will have a hard time locating  a copy of it    1.0
   the hephzibah menuhin amadeus quartet  angel   and victor babin festival quartet   rca victor  editions  give us superlative string playing  both in symphonic style  crippled  by unimaginative piano playing    4287.000575741969
  babin has acquired some of schnabel keyboard manner    1.0
 but his playing is of limited insight    1.0
  badura skoda vienna  konzerthaus  westminster  and demus schubert quartet   deutsche grammophon  are both warm toned    1.247866578374185e+16
  but rather slack and tensionless    1.0
 playing with a group  of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble    1.0
 in  much the same vein as that of the last mentioned pianists    1.0
 telefunken  has accorded him beautiful sound    1.0
 and this bargain priced disc  it  sells for  2    1.0
98  is worthy of consideration    1.0
   returning once again  to the schnabel reissue    1.0
 i am beguiled anew by the magnificence  of this pianistmusical penetration    11381924904233.63
 here is truly a  great recording  of the century     1.0
 and its greatness is by no means diminished  by the fact that it is not quite perfect    1.0
 this recording surely belongs  in everyonecollection    1.0
  must records always sound like records    1.0
   from the beginning  of commercial recording    1.0
 new discs purported to be indistinguishable  from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation    1.0
 many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones    1.0
 they supply the  ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re creation  of the original    1.0
 on the basis of what they give us we can know how the  young caruso sang    1.0
 appreciate the distinctive qualities of  parsifal   under karl muckbaton    5.0835779790502534e+17
 or sense the type of ensemble toscanini  created in his years with the new york philharmonic    1.0
   since  the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago    1.0
  the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold    1.0
 in many  cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational  effects    1.0
 the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning  as the gap between sound and substance became clearer    1.0
 other  innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing  to acquire in time the status of classics    1014.6698144075816
 if we return to them today    1.0
  we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them  still pleasing    1.0
   records sound like records because they provide  a different sort of experience than live music    1.0
 this difference is  made up of many factors    1.0
 some of them are obvious    1.0
 such as the fact  that we associate recorded and live music with our reponses and behavior  in different types of environments and social settings    1.0
  music often  sounds best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something  more comfortable than a theatre seat    94.73952703000272
  records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey  the true color    1.0
 and pitch  of the original    1.0
 any alteration of one of these factors is distortion    1.0
  although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced  that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests    1.0
  yet it is the accumulation of distortion    1.0
 the fitting together of  fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness    84807628.57082729
  that makes records sound like records    1.0
 the sound may be good    1.0
  but if you know the real thing    1.0
 you know that what you are hearing  is only a clever imitation    1.0
   commandnew brahms second is  a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather  than a copy of one    1.0
 like the recent  scheherazade  from london   high fidelity    1.0
 it is successful because emphasis  has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than  on creating sensational effects    1.0
 only those with  truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the  engineers  triumph    1.0
   the easiest way to describe this release  is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg  performance with minimal alteration of its musical values    1.0
 the engineering  as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness    1.0
 the effect of  the recording is very open and natural    1.0
 with the frequency emphasis  exactly what you would expect from a live performance    1.0
 this absence of  peaky highs and beefed up bass not only produces greater fidelity    658945.1257705064
 but  it eliminates listener fatigue    1.0
 a contributing factor is the perspective    1.0
  the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained    390327697099830.25
 the orchestra  is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes    1.0
 and other noises incidental to playing    1.0
 yet you feel the orchestra  is near at hand    1.0
 and the individual instruments have the same firm  presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically  perfect hall    1.0
 command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation    1.0
  the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its  full sonority    1.0
 yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer    1.0
 the  timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance    1.0
  all of this would be wasted    1.0
 if the performance lacked  authority and musical distinction    1.0
 for me it has more of both elements  than the majority of its competitors    1.0
 steinberg seems to have gone  directly back to the score    1.0
 and has built his  performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly  what brahms set down on paper    1.0
  more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react  strongly when they hear this one    1.0
 without losing the distinctive undertow  of brahmsian rhythm    1.793283987573497e+17
 the pacing is firm and the over all performance  has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect    509.14042628988324
  the  presto ma non assai  of the first trio of the scherzo is  taken literally and may shock you    5901.82238223035
 as the real  allegro con spirito   of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet    1.0
  the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way  it sings    1.0
 steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element  which must dominate in this score    1.0
 and he manages at times to create  the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song    1.0
   the  engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result    1.0
 too  many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody  and its accompaniment    1.0
 the command technique invites you to listen  to the depth of the orchestration    1.0
 your ear takes you into the ensemble    1.0
  and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously  were apparent only in the score    1.0
 it is this sort of experience  that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance  for the home music listener    1.0
  the first substantially complete stereo  giselle   and the only one  of its scope since feyerfour sided  lp edition of 1958 for  angel     10583.822556599594
 likely to provide more horrid fascination  than enjoyment    1.0
 the already faded pastel charms of the nai ve  music itself vanish entirely in fistoularimelodramatic contrasts  between ultravehement brute power and chilly    673095.4033367226
  and in its engineers  frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic  impact and earsplitting brilliance    1.0
 the recording sounds as though  it had been  doctored for super high fidelity     1.0
 the home listener  is overpowered    1.0
 but the experience is a far from pleasant  one    1.0
 as with the penultimate  giselle  release  wolffabridgment  for  rca victor  i find the cleaner    1.0
 less razor edged  monophonic  version    1.1916411676106615e+39
 for all its lack of big stage spaciousness    1.0
 the more  aurally tolerable  but this may be the result of processing defects  in my  sd copies    1.0
  at the westminster  kc dog show in madison square garden    7758073.529429053
  new york on the second day    1.0
 the finals of the junior class  brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class    1.0
  the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far  south as kentucky    1.0
 this year several entries from canada were entered  which made the junior class international    1.0
   forty six of  the 53 juniors who mailed in entries were present    86084.49652235428
 it was interesting  to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other  classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior class    1.0
  as has been the custom for the past several years    1.0
 arranged for the juniors   meeting before the class    1.0
 and invited two speakers from the dog  world to address them    1.0
 jr  speaks   after the juniors  were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the finals of the  junior class    1.0
 jr  was introduced as  the first speaker    1.0
   in her opening remarks mrs  long also  welcomed the juniors and stated    1.0
  there isn t any other show quite  like westminster    1.0
 i know because this is my 37th year with hardly  a break    1.0
 mrs  long still feels the same unique spirit of westminster  which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably  will not appreciate in full for a number of years    1.0
   twenty  years ago her daughter betsey long    1.0
 then 13 years of age    1.0
 won the  grand challenge trophy    1.0
 childrenhandling class  as they were  called then  at westminster    1.0
 no sooner had betsey come out of the  ring than mrs  long walked into the working competition with  ch  cadet or noranda    283.8100313394577
  speaking from long years of experience    1.0
 mrs  long advised the juniors    1.0
    when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement     1.0
 dogs have a way of sensing our feelings    1.0
 when you and  your dog step into the junior ring    1.0
 it should be just what the dog  wants to do as much as what you want him to do    1.0
 if you walk into the  ring because it is fun to show your dog    1.0
 he will feel it and give you  a good performance    1.0
 what is expected of him  and the way the class is conducted    1.0
 right up through the flash bulbs  of the photographers     1.0
  and what have you left    1.0
  either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage  a sure sign  that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop    1.0
 or a  bored dog because you are more interested in something else  maybe  the way you look    1.0
 or the date you have after the class    1.0
 or you are just  doing this to please the parents    1.0
    the reason you are in  the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most  attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can  produce    1.0
 aids sounds more like a pony club    1.0
 or horsemanship classes   riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar    1.0
    your  aids are your attitude    1.0
 which comes through your voice    1.0
 your hands  and legs  voice to encourage    1.0
 discourage or whatever the need may  be    1.0
 hands to guide or restrain    1.0
 legs to produce motion and rate of  speed    1.0
 without right attitude the other aids just do not work right     1.0
  mrs  long wished all the juniors luck in the class and  stated    131440.6217402769
 and may you all continue to show at westminster  in the years to come     1.0
 second speaker   the  second speaker was harvey barcus    1.0
 president of the dog writers  ass n of america    3338654.6676349337
   mr  barcus spoke on the subject of  scholarships for juniors  with which he is very familiar    1.0
 last year  a boy he knows and helped in journalism won the thoroughbred racing  ass n scholarship which is worth  10    79090.56551679106
 he gave a resume of  the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship    1.0
   junior showmanship is an extremely worthy project and  should be earnestly encouraged     1.0
 is one of mr  barcus  strong  beliefs    1.0
 he feels very forcibly that the american kennel club should  take a more active part in encouraging the junior division    1.0
 mr  barcus also wished all the juniors  luck in their class    1.0
    westminster show notes   instead of 3 a m   in the past    1.0
 the juniors class at westminster was held at 4    1.0
 this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the  show  a great advantage to them    1.0
   before the juniors entered  the ring the steward announced that after all juniors had moved  their dogs around the ring and set them up    1.0
 they could relax with their  dogs    1.0
 each junior was going to be judged individually    1.0
  this thoughtful gesture was well received by the juniors as the  class had an entry of 46 juniors and it took approximately one hour    150.52962090895872
  45 minutes to judge the class    1.0
    anne hone rogers judges 28th finals    this year anne hone rogers    602306766013.4014
 this is the third time in 28 years of junior showmanship at  westminster that a lady handler has judged the class    210.7780109927223
   as the  juniors entered the ring    1.0
 stated over  the public address system that this was the 28th year that westminster  has held the finals of the junior competition    1.0
 juniors competed  last year at american kennel club and canadian kennel club recognized  shows to be eligible to compete in this class  the finals  for the year    1.0
 a junior who won two or more wins in the open class  was eligible    1.0
    the purpose of the junior showmanship competition  is to teach and encourage juniors to become good sportsmen    1.0
 many  adults showing at westminster today are products of this class    1.0
   it seemed an almost impossible job for miss rogers to select  4 winners from the 46 juniors entered    1598.8924050548937
 a large number of these juniors  have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners    1.0
  after the judge moved all the dogs individually    1.0
 she selected  several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring    1.0
 she  then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship    1.0
    international champion of the year   betty lou ham    1.0

 last year susan also placed  3rd in the finals at westminster    1.0
 from the records we keep   susan is the only junior who has placed in the junior classes in  both united states and canada    1.0
   most juniors  who were entered in the finals are seasoned campaigners and not only  show and win in junior classes but score in the breed classes as  well    36.53944956678685
    entries increasing  requirements raised   in 1960    2.582514615954113e+21

    judging  class for intermediates proposed   it has been suggested many times  that a class be set up for the juniors who are overage and cannot enter  the junior classes    31.444228921148454
 for some time this writer has been suggesting  a junior judging class for intermediates over 16 and under 20 years  of age who are ineligible to compete in the junior class    1.0
  such a class was tried out successfully at the westchester  kc  show recently    1.0
 not only were the contestants pleased with the class    1.0
  but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day    1.0
 the intermediates  in the class with the judge were asked to pick 4 winners  and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice  of the judge    1.0
   we suggested this class in the horse world and  it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows  at the recent horse show convention in new york it was stated  that this intermediate judging class is meeting with great success  and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world    1.0
  this class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given  a chance    1.0
 a leading junior handler entered  the dog judging contest  junior  at the international  kc  of chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any junior  since the class  inception    40.95137804776367
 juniors who attend this chicago show  should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help  to them    1.0
    more volunteer handlers needed to judge   superintendents  at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed  handler to judge junior showmanship competition    60.301307221333474
 the founder of  the junior showmanship competition the late leonard brumby    1.0
 sr    for whom the trophy is named after at westminster  was an outstanding  handler and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit  in a dog show starting with the junior showmanship division    1.0
  some years ago this class was judged by celebrities who knew  nothing of what was required of a juniorability to show a dog    1.0
 to  overcome this unfair judging    1.0
 the a k c  requires that a licensed  handler be present to judge the class    1.0
 if the superintendents  do not receive more cooperation from handlers    1.0
 it has been suggested  that licensed judges also be qualified to judge this class    1.0

   american technology  in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful  interest in american boating    1.0
 i wonder if anyone ever bothered  to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors    1.0
 americans  excel over any country in the world in the long run    1.0
  whose technology is not quite primitive    1.0
 is still in the dark ages  when it comes to improving the outboard motor    1.0
   now  here is truly a marvel    1.0
 the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal  range of one to 80 horsepower    1.0
 unheard of a few years ago for a two  cycle engine in quantity production    1.0
 these engines can be removed  from a boat with relative ease    1.0
 wherein lies their greatest advantage    1.0
  their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american pocketbook    1.0
 the  range being about  150 to  1    1.0
   great  thought  has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population  of the country    1.0
 and to making the owning of a boat simpler    1.0
 there  was a time when    1.0
 if a man wanted to purchase a boat    1.0
 it was necessary  for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he  could touch the tiller or wheel    1.0
 having a boat financed through a local  bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended    1.0
  marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non dealer  areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later    178.91722480273708
  terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down  payments run about the same as for automobiles    1.0
 individual  financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaserearning  power    1.0
 credit rating and local bank policy    1.0
 and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as  boats    1.0
 terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those  for home appliances    1.0
   when the automobile was in its embryonic  stage    1.0
 such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit  understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about  the only rule governing where    1.0
 when and how fast a car could go    1.0
 when  air travel was in its infancy    1.0
 the sky was considered big enough and  high enough for all    1.0
 man had enough to worry about managing to get  up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft    1.0
 it was  much the same with pleasure boating at first    1.0
   as the ungoverned days of the automobile  and the airplane are long since relegated to the past    1955.1300610291128
 so is the carefree  attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do    1.0
 there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating    1.0
  laws on boating vary according to the state in which the  craft is to be used and according to its horsepower    1.0
 what may be acceptable  in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line    11956.061025742403
  the main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according  to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally  used    1.0
 if your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure  boats    1.0
 you must apply for a number from the u s  coast guard for  any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower  before it can be used on federal waterways    16.126303733579544
   state numbering  laws differ from each other in many ways    215518228125407.12
 fees are not the  same  and some states do not require certain craft    1.0
 such as sailboats with  no power    1.0
 to be registered at all    1.0
 many states have laws regulating  the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age  of motor boat operators    1.0
 states reserve for communities  the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities    1875849.8726852476
  it is always wise to consult your marine dealer    1.0
 local yacht  or boat club secretary    1.0
 or local law enforcement officers if you are  not positive what the regulations are    1.0
 ignorance of the law is no better  excuse on the water than it is on land    1.0
 lack of ability and common  sense can lead to just as much tragedy    1.0
   hand in hand with  the legislative program is the industryself originated and directed  safety program    1.0
 foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the  rapid growth of the sport    1.0
 the industry has been supporting an intense    1.0
  coordinated educational program with great success since 1947    1.0
  a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the  enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers    1.0
 the industry  has been its own watch dog    1.0
 with u s  coast guard cooperation    2.3994483807936794e+20
  the american boat and yacht council was formed to develop recommended  practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference  to safety    1.0
   industry interest in safety goes even farther    1.0
 the yacht safety bureau was reorganized by the national  association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance  underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service  for boats and their equipment    31.269118989895873
 a new waterfront site for the bureau  is now being built at atlantic city    1.0
 to provide the  most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the  sport safe    1.0
   in addition to these activities    1.0
  with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue    1.0
 as well  as other associations and individual manufacturers    1.0
 and public services in regard to proper boat handling  and safety afloat    71213.39230680797
   it is important to note the work of  the united states power squadrons and the u s  coast guard  auxiliary    327.87297531969784
 each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in  seamanship piloting and small boat handling    2979442367039.497
 these are not governmentally  subsidized organizations    5.829415744443876e+21
000 persons will  receive this free instruction    1.0
   as america on wheels was responsible  for an industry of motor courts    1.0
 and drive in establishments  where you can dine    1.0
 or make a bank deposit    1.0
  the ever increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries  designed especially to accommodate them    1.0
 for  the boatman there are marinas    1.0
   the word marina was coined by   naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational  boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative  comfort    1.0
 marina is used to indicate a municipal or  commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome  or all of the following available    250.94925146920616
 indicates a waterfront type of hotel where  a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises  as well as other services    17044.07527344303
 boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel    1.0
  it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically  to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as  outboards    89.82376139728028
  boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities  may rightfully be called marinas    1.0
   a recent survey disclosed there  are about 4    1.0
000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and  boatyards in the united states    1.445200447720701e+22
 the majority of which are equipped  to handle outboard boats    7647287.504022293
  the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical  puzzle    37130474.25138864
 the principles can be applied to  any track and signal arrangement    1.0
 in the frame are two sets of bars  which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous  moves    1.0
 the main set of bars are the  tappets  and one tappet  is connected to each lever    47937.500820475
 if the lever is pulled to clear a signal  or move a switch    1.0
 the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at  the same time    1.0
   close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking  bars    87608470565.10864
 these can also move a short distance but at right angles  to the tappets    1.0
 the number of locking bars required depends on how many  false moves must be prevented    386.27862015704414
   in the sides of the tappets  are notches with sloping sides    1909240070.903209
 and connection between the tappets and  locking bars consist of cams called  dogs     3.3675234641611692e+22
 two or more dogs are  mounted on each locking bar    1.0
 these slide into and out of the notches  in the tappets as the tappets are moved    158707.21632490377
 suppose the operator pulls  the lever to clear a particular signal    279131262914.9243
 this also pulls the tappet connected  to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches  to the side    3347.9964379239136
 thus moving one or more locking bars    1.0
 the dogs on the  other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other  tappets    1.0
 pulling one signal to clear locks all the  other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal  is again restored to normal    43.74473117114024
   interlocking signals are normally  at stop or  red  position    1012953.9785061426
 and a lever must be pulled to  clear   the signal    1.0
 this is not necessarily to green    1.0
 for in  some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it  into the  plant     1.0
   there are other basic rules    1.0
 a turnout  may have two levers    1.0
 one to actually move the switch points    1.0
 the other  to lock the points    1.0
 a signal cannot be cleared until all the related  turnouts are properly thrown  and  locked    369782.04174313607
 such locks are nearly  always used where the switch points  face  oncoming traffic    1.0
 the  lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that  a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point    37.26702318769512
 if the points aren t  thrown all the way    4.0451275214939245e+17
 the turnout cannot be locked    1.0
  the signal cannot be cleared    1.0
 these locks on turnouts are  called  facing point locks     128200853.51474153
   figs  1 6 show typical arrangements  of track and signals    382740084915248.7
 each diagram is accompanied by a  dog  chart     1.0
 a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular  lever will lock if pulled    1.0
 the lines connecting the wedge shaped  dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars    33722.41292384365
  by studying the track signal diagrams you ll note several  other details    84220.0747833262
 derails  mechanical track devices that actually guide  the wheels off the rails if a train passes a  stop  signal  are  used in many instances    15.798713512903145
  home  signals have two blades    1.0
 the blacked in  blades indicate a fixed aspect  the blade does not move    1.0
 as  an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal  is seen in advance when he passes the  distant  signal located  beyond the limits of the interlocking plant    1.0
 in some low speed situations    1.0
  the distant signal is fixed at caution    1.0
 in other instances where  there is no automatic block signaling    1.0
 the distant has only green  and yellow aspects    1.0
   so much for the prototype    1.0
   the interlocking  frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then  installed on paul larsonrailroad follows the fig  1 scheme  and is shown beginning in fig  7    9309779.130479014
 here how it can be built    1.0
    frame   the sizes of pieces needed  for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within fig  7    256.7694329587309
 most  of the bars being 1 8   brass in 1 4   and 1 2   widths    1.0
  you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers  and locks as you wish    149.87036871796892
 our instructions assume you are building  this particular frame    1.0
 which is for a junction    1.0
 and square with a smooth file or sanding  disk    126440495.66788137
 start with the right hand piece   b     1.0
 soldering  it to the lower piece   a  of the same material but 12    long    1.0
 let exactly 1   of   a  extend beyond   b  and  use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees    1.0
   now  lay 12 pieces of   f cut 5 3 4   long side by side but separated  by 12 pieces of the same material 1 2   sq     100.08765504295482
 this gives you the  spacing for locating the left hand piece   b     307187.36988717713
 compress the assembly  when you make the mark to show the location for   b     1.0
 solder  this second   b  to   a  at right angles    1.0
 there  should be 10   between the two parallel members and each should be  1   from an end of the long piece    1.0
   cap this assembly  with  spacing bars in place  with a   f bar    134879.00910750817
 tack solder all the 1 2    sq  pieces to the 10   and 12   members    41784121.2246914
 these will be drilled  and tapped later on    1.0
   now cut five   f locking bar spacers   which run horizontally     5434051216.936916
 position these using six intermediate temporary    f spacers and locate the upper 12   bar   a     13470413.74184315
 solder  it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame    3019447.8588158507
 now place 12 pieces  1 2   sq  on this edge as we did before and space them with  the 5 3 4   long  tappets     90.11120077834742
 cap with a   f  bar and tack solder in place    273725.4662674716
 cap the locking bar spacers with two    f directly under the first two   b  pieces    130978.57738301753
 remove all the  loose spacing bars    1.0
   mark and center punch all the holes required  for screws to hold this assembly together    4181.441132806034
 placement  of these holes is not critical    1.0
 but they should be located so that  the centers are about 1 8   from any edge    1.0
 drill all no  50 and  counter drill all except the   a  pieces size 43    7291.051469521051

 solder a   f piece of  brass and file to the tapered shape shown in figs  6 and 8    338507.9857344742
 these  will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts    8565483.185831094
   fitting  the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job  since stop screws    438.85688119302125
 tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced  many times    998.5143535371765
 as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become  a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before  the part you are working on is accessible    1.0
 a little extra work  here will pay off with a smooth    1.0
 snug fitting machine when you are finished    1.0
  each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work  progresses to insure snug fitting    13924113.569652127
   the order of fitting is not  too important    1.0
 we started with the first row of bars and worked  our way back    1.0
 since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs  and notches is used throughout    1.0
 we will only describe the construction  of one locking bar    1.0
 figs  7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions    1.0

  scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on  mathematics    1.0
 without math the men who are continually seeking the causes  of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go  round  would not have any means of analyzing    1.0
 and communicating  the things they discover and learn    1.0
 math and the formulas that  allow it to be applied to different problems are    1.0
 essential  to any scientific endeavor    1.0
   hot rodding is a science    1.0
 it not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate  on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit  but it is    1.0
 but because science is based on mathematics  doesn t mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician    16250.486016397608
  a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years  without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems    1.0
 he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and  the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few  formulas that apply to rodding    1.0
   a mathematical formula is nothing  more than a pattern for solving a specific problem    1.0
 it places the  various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation  to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can  be computed    1.0
   the first step in using a formula is to insert the  numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions  in the formula    123.10912879854854
 this changes the formula to an  equation     1.0
 the  equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem    1.0
  equations for rodding formulas are not complicated    601762090.5945305
 they involve  only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic  classes    1.0
 it is essential that the various mathematical symbols  used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes  can be done properly and in their correct order    1.0
   the  symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers  placed one above the other    1.0
 the lower number is always divided into the  upper number    1.0
   f   the symbol for multiplication is         1.0
  it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row    1.0
    f numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any  order    1.0
 the result will be the same regardless of the order used    1.0
  the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign    1.0
 this is  nothing more than a dash    1.0
 it separates two or more numbers    1.0
 the number  on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on  the left of the symbol    1.0
   f when more than two figures  are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried  out from the left to right if the result is to be correct    195.2278478272277
 10 from 25 equals 15    1.0
 then 6 from 15 equals  9    1.0
   addition is indicated by the    symbol    1.0
 the symbol is  used to separate two or more numbers    1.0
   f numbers separated  by addition symbols may be placed in any order    1.0
   when solving  an equation that involves division as well as other steps    1.0
 do all  the division steps first  to reduce those parts of the equation to their  numerical value    1.0
 and addition can then  be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left  end of the equation and working toward the right    1.0
 completing the  division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication    1.0
   f this would be reduced  by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12    1.0
 this part  of the equation would then become 4    1.0
 fractions  should be converted to their decimal equivalents    46781136827.18424
 the easiest  way to do this is with a conversion chart    1.0
 charts for this purpose  are available from many sources    1.0
 they are included in all types of mathematical  handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision  measuring instruments    363.478308812082
   the various mathematical processes can  be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places    1.0
  shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental  effect on the accuracy of the final result    1.0
 a constant is a number that remains the same  regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant  equation    1.0
 it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved  correctly    1.0
   rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport    11792715.23934461
  the answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases  and    1.0
 are necessary for completing entry blanks for different  events    1.0
 one formula is as important as another    1.0
 some formulas are used more than others    1.0
 we ll take  them in the general order of their popularity    1.0
    engine displacement    a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine    22122310.269218016
  displacement is sometimes referred to as  swept volume     1.0
 most  entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information  because of class restrictions    1.0
 it is good to be able to compute  displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking  can be computed    1.0
   factors involved in the displacement formula  are the bore diameter of the enginecylinders    89180.73345142788
 the length of the  piston stroke    1.0
 the number of cylinders in the engine    1.0
 which is one quarter of 3    1.0
 another constant  known as  pi     1.0
 pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions  of circles    1.0
 the engine displacement formula is  the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type  with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the  engine    1.0
 the cross sectional area of the cylinders is determined and  then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying  the area by the stroke length    71.5217155406853
 which is the equivalent of the length  of the cylinders    1.0
 multiplying the result by the number of cylinders  in the engine gives the enginetotal displacement    1.0
 and fractions of inches will give  the displacement in cubic inches    1.0
 dimensions in centimeters and fractions  of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters    cc     11956.061025742403
 one cubic inch equals 16    8.0433542862283135e+37
 letconsider a standard  283 cubic inch chevy  v8    29821711910484.684
 these engines have a cylinder diameter  of 3 7 8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches    1363409.995087145
 with  the fractions converted to decimals    1.0
   to arrive  at the answer    1.0
 multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of  the group and working to the right    1.0
 the different steps will look like  this    1.0
   f    compression ratio   a cylindercompression ratio  is computed by comparing the cylindervolume    1.0
  with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber    1.0
  cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber  volume must be measured with a liquid    1.0
   cylinder volume is  determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula    1.0
   to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers  in the cylinder head    1.0
 install the valves and spark plug in the chamber  and support the head so that its gasket surface is level    1.0
 then pour  water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill  the chamber to its gasket surface    1.0
 do not overfill the chamber    1.0
 this  is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension    1.0
  such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface  around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber    1.0
  the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting  the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from  the original quantity    75.86296355428209
 most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters    cc     1.0
 making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches    1.0
 the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic  centimeters    1.0
 the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will  be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are  used    13253.41663825007
 the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be  quoted in the same terms    1.0
   the volume of the cylinder opening  in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square  inches by the gasketthickness in thousandths of an inch    1.0
 sometimes  it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening  but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy  that it won t affect the final computation    1232.19566034542
 the volume of the opening  is added to the combustion chamber volume    1.0
   another thing  that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between  the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston  is in top dead center position    1.0
 compute this volume by measuring  the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately  as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring  device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth    116.88185395057359
 the  formula for this step is    1.0
   f this volume is added to the total volume  of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening    1.0
 the total of  these three volumes is the  final combustion chamber volume     1.0
  after the factors just described have been computed    1.0
 they are applied  to the following formula    1.0
   f   for an example letdream  up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic  inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches    132.4272186981091
 applying these figures  to the formula we get the equation    1.0
   f the compression ratio is  10 to 1    1.0
   this method of computing compression ratio cannot be  used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly  shaped heads    16686.80072423219
 any irregularity on the piston heads will make  it impossible    1.0
 to determine the final combustion  chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot  be readily computed    1.0
 the only way to determine the final combustion  chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid  while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston  is in top dead center position    13.77918516944338
    gear ratio  speed relationships    there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships  of car speed    1101.230932559996
 by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can  be determined for any combination of the other three    1.0
   to simplify  the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of  the factors    1.0
 these are    mph for car speed    rpm  for engine crankshaft speed    r for rear axle gear ratio   w for tire size   tire size can be determined in  several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is  by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly    71246.80951202115
 this  is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire  is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft    1.0
 a tire must be inflated  to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to  its operating weight when this measurement is made    94.29248713257557
 the measurement  must be in inches    1.0
 any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement  must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics    72.32652059824952
  when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used  in the formula    1.0
   to determine car speed for a given combination  of engine speed    1.0
   f  for an engine speed of 5000  rpm    1.0
 a gear ratio of 4    1.0
 and a  tire radius of 13 inches    81238849842403.52
 the equation would look like this    1.0
   f  to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three  factors the formula is    1.0
   f using the same figures as for the  previous example    1.0
   f   to determine the  rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors    125065.14604840378
   f using the figures from the previous examples    1.0

  the average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun  we  ran a survey to find out  but healways on the lookout for new and  better arms    1.0
 hemore than a reader of outdoor articles    1.0
 he a real hunter and shooter    1.0
 eager to improve his sport    1.0
 if you re  that kind of sportsman we re here to help you    1.0
 you ve probably  given a lot of christmas season thought to the guns in your rack    1.0
  but itnot easy to decide on a new one    1.0
 you still have time to  drop a few hints about the gifts you d appreciate most    1.0
 the time  to decide on them is now    1.0
 i ve taken a close  look at this yearcrop of new models    1.0
 with my  comments and judgments    1.0
 take your pick  and start dropping  those hints    1.0
   first on my own list would be two arms  a rifle  and a handgun  that qualify as new in the strictest sense    1.0
 a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn t constitute  a truly new design    8809706099.054016
 such modifications are all for the best but  it takes something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change  arms making concepts    1.0
   bill rugerlong awaited deerstalker   under  110  is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the  modern theory of high velocity fans    34.80590637081852
  fast firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug  at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for  our most popular big game  whitetail    40.536002039032375
   ruger reports that  on his recent african safari the little     1.0
44 magnum cartridge was a  real work horse    1.0
 small antelope were generally grassed with one shot    258862.47267746268
44 magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck    1.0
 kob and wart hog with  deadly efficiency    94054032834814.62
44 magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to  me    1.0
 at least five years ago    1.0
 tom robinson of marlin made up an over under  double rifle for me in this caliber    1.0
 using the now defunct model  90 action in 20 gauge size    280922.8106814229
 after figuring out how to regulate the  barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact    1.0
 we fired this  little 20 inch barrel job on my home range and in marlinunderground  test gallery    1.0
 we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued bill  ruger in his first experiments    1.0
 three or four bullets would be  placed well in a six inch bull at 100 yards and then    1.0
  one could stray far out of the group    1.0
   ruger learned that this  was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting  the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet    1.0
 but even without jacketed bullets    1.0
 i  had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening day deer hunt  that first year    1.0
 within half an hour i jumped a six point buck that  hop skipped through a rhododendron thicket    1.0
 and i caught him just behind  the left foreleg at 60 yards    1.0
 he moved only about 30 feet after  the 240 grain slug hit him  and this was after the bullet had passed  through a sapling    2994.8543470833274
   three more deer have fallen to this same  gun    1.0
 and all were one shot kills    1.0
 my double was made with standard weight  revolver barrels  before cutting to revolver length     1.0
 and although  it compares well in other respects    1.0
 which only scales about 6 1 2 pounds    1.0
   if ever  a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter    1.0
 the deerstalker  points with the ease    1.0
 speed and precision of a fine imported  double shotgun    1.0
 and its trigger pull is light and sharp    1.0
 the 240 grain  bullet leaves the muzzle at 1    189486.03697865328
 which gives it all the smash  needed at woods ranges    1.0
 with five shots at the immediate command  of the huntertrigger finger    1.0
 the gun and load are a deadly combination    1.0
  the second really new development this year was a revolver  handling a different sort of varmint load  the     433.1585270838093
22 remington jet  magnum center fire    1.0
 the  fine and familiar smith   wesson magnum revolver  about  110     42749393081448.03
  long a top quality handgun among target arms    1.0
  40 grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2    1.0
 and it the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge    1.0
 with a mid range  rise of about an inch over a 100 yard range    1.0
 this is a varmint load    1.0
 itmuch too explosive for small edible game    1.0
  it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry  of feathers    211230.36543929938
   the most intriguing aspect of the  s w magnum  chambered for the new jet is that it can also fire standard     32500.467272632734
22 rim fires  by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers    902271454617.2948
 you may therefore  convert the gun into a small game and plinking arm    1.0
 although the difference  in the point of impact  jet vs  rim fire  can be somewhat disconcerting    4477.198906985822
  the accuracy of the jet cartridge is fine    1.0
 i tested  it in my scoped  s w and it was good enough to allow me to hit a  chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the handgun  steadily    133.0446259205311
  61   the fact that the deerstalker  and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn t  mean that 1961 didn t see changes in models    1481739.9277011272
  aside from the ruger carbine    1.0
 a number of hunting rifles have been  introduced for the first time    1.0
 here are the brands  in alphabetical  order  and the new models    962726.2429810149
   newcomers to the american hunter  are the browning group of bolt action    1.0
 they have  fine  fn actions and a better than average finish on both the metal  and the stock wood    651.7289139758317
 barrel weights vary sensibly with the various  calibers available    8754533.584624223
 and these include the standard bores  about  165   plus the magnums  around  170     47737418.32518643
 shotgun type rubber recoil pads are standard  on all of the magnums except the     291962048959028.56
 stock designs are excellent  for use with scopes    1.0
   coltcenter fire 1961 rifles are  all made with sako actions    1.0
 the long action  about  135 for the standard  coltsman and  200 for the custom version     1.0
  fn actions  were used for the larger cartridges    1.0
   high standard has  introduced a     1.0
 in two grades  field and special   less than  45 and just over  45    1.0
22 magnum rim fire  rifles    1.0
 1961lone newcomer was the kodiak model 260 autoloader   around  60     224598035441522.97
 previously known as jefferson arms    1.0
 kodiak has given  this 11 shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design    1.0
 and the  260 is the first autoloader to handle     1.0
  marlin  has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings    1.0
 the  model 99  under  45  is a light weight    9755448.327071493
22 rim fire auto  with a tubular magazine that holds 18 long rifles    1.0
 and the test rifle i tried was completely  trouble free in functioning    1.0
 the 989  about  40  is an even newer     1.0
 this one with a seven  or 12 shot clip    1.0
   once again the  mossberg targo outfit has appeared    1.0
 but this time as a bolt action rifle shotgun  combination    7075410.271084321
 the bore is unrifled but is provided with an  insert tube which is rifled and which    1.0
 gives pretty fair  accuracy even though itonly 3 1 2 inches long    1.0
 you can unscrew  this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with     6196.06507699633
22 shotshells   to break the little targo clay targets    279414482591.12823
 a trap for throwing  these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can  throw his own targets    773.9270140727039
 a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular  hand trap are also available    1.0
 you can have your choice of a seven shot  repeater    1.0
 the  340tr  about  40  or a single shot    1.0
   the targo is a good outfit for fun shooting  or for economic wing shooting practice    1.0
 but ittougher than it looks  to run up a score on the clay birds    1.0
 they ll travel 50 feet or  more when thrown from the spring trap but italmost impossible to  break one after it passes the 35 foot mark    80.67305239647726
 the combination of thin  pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds    1116.1994469646743
   big magnum calibers appeared in the remington line  for 1961    1.0
 with the addition of the     1.0
458 to the list of model  725 s    1.0
 these are made on special order only    1.0
 in kodiak grade   about  310     1.0
 with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads    37706440.929885626
  they weigh around nine pounds    1.0
   a shortened version of the  highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961    479901.1943702053
 about  15 more for a deluxe grade  has an 18 1 2 inch  barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year model 760 pump with a short barrel    728.6770637433077
 this design is hard to beat  for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard    1.0
   the latest versions of the famous  savage model 99 are the 99 featherweight  about  125  and the  99 deluxe  under  135     27429.333333813127
 which have a top tang safety and improved trigger  design    1.0
 the replacement of the slide lock side safety catch will  make this lever action favorite more appealing than ever since the new  safety is easier and faster to operate    53.93698596488038
  61    a fresh crop of beginners  guns showed up in 1961    182200.64582893203
 and they re  good bets for your christmas gift list if you re wondering what to  get for a youngster    1.0
 the most unusual of them is the ithaca 49  about   20    1.0
  5 for a saddle scabbard   a lever action single shot patterned  after the famous winchester lever action and featuring the western  look    1.0
 because of its traditional lines    1.0
 it probably has more kid  appeal than any other model    1.0
 the action is a drop block    1.0
   marlinlatest is also designed  for the beginning shooter    1.0
 although ita full sized rifle with plenty  of barrel weight and ample stock    7711017.127737396
 this is the model 122  about   20     1.0
 ita single shot bolt action with an automatic safety   i e     128769.98578949441
 the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun  cocked for the next shot    1.0
 and this model  is a good first gun    1.0
22 single shot remington   514c  around  20     1.0
 which comes with a 21 inch barrel and a  short  12 1 2 inch  stock    6561.7026619284325
 itjust right for a boy of 12 1 2    1.0
  a beginnershotgun has also been introduced this year    1.0
  the single barrel stevens  940y  under  35  is made with a side lever  rather than a top tang lever because many youngsters aren t strong  enough to operate a top tang to open a gun  and the side lever does  indeed open very easily    3108.51641213437
 this gun has a 12 1 2 inch stock and is  available in either 20 or     601.0131355660532
 thereanother addition to  the stevens line    1.0
 the pump action model 77 in     4.181545249160332e+18
 which  you may or may not consider a kidgun    1.0
 many experienced hunters  like this gauge and type of scattergun too    1.0
  61   although  there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year    1.0
  a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit  the market    1.0
 a browning trap version of the superposed  over under    1.0
 the broadway  from  350 up    1.0
 differs  from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore  end    1.0
 a cushion recoil pad and a barrel wide ventilated rib for fast  sighting    2971304553098717.5
   the colt line now includes a new scattergun    1.0
 the standard  or custom pump model  about  90 and  150    1.0
   firearms international has introduced another  import    1.0
 a 12 gauge  over under very much like the old remington 32  which was  so fine  a gun that today a used one still brings high prices    1.0
   high  standard has also added two models to its line    1.0
 the supermatic trophy   prices begin at less than  135 and depend on grade and optional  features  is a 12 gauge auto    1.0
 the flite king trophy  beginning at  just over  85  is a pump gun in 12 or 16    875.6560258761824
 either model is a very good  dollar value    1.0
   mossberglatest contribution to the field is  the model 500  from  73    1.0
 this is an improved version of the old  model 200    1.0
 a pump action 12 gauge shotgun    1.0
 see page 24 for a complete  report on it    1.0
22 jet  which  i coupled with the deerstalker carbine as one of the yeartwo  biggest developments  few significant innovations appeared among  1961handguns    945.9723037929269
 prop   coaching had declined  considerably by 1905    1.0
 but the sign was still there    1.0
 near the old  wells fargo building in san francisco    1.0
 creaking in the fog as it  had for thirty years    1.0
 john vernon had had all the patronage he cared  for  he had prospered    1.0
 but he could not retire from horsedom    1.0
 coaching  was in his blood    1.0
 he had two interests in life    1.0
 the pleasures  of the table and driving    1.0
 twice a week he drove his tallyho over the  santa cruz road    1.0
 upland and through the redwood forest    1.0
 with orchards  below him at one hand    1.0
 and glimpses of the pacific at the other    1.0
 the  journey back he made along the coast road    1.0
  every lantern of the tallyho ablaze    1.0
   the southward route  was the classic run in california    1.0
 his patronage  on this stretch was made up largely of san franciscans  regulars    1.0
 they did not complain  at the inhuman hour of starting  seven in the morning     1.0
 which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco    1.0
  breakfast was at the palace hotel    1.0
 luncheon was somewhere in the  mountain forest    1.0
 and dinner was either at boulder creek or at santa  cruz    1.0
   gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring    1.0
 so  halts were contrived between meals    1.0
 who rode  with vernon on the box    1.0
 would break open a hamper and produce filets  of smoked bass or sturgeon    4662502846.456726
 and a rum sangaree  to be heated over a spirit lamp    1.0
   in spring and in autumn  the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend  of mine    1.0
 and bits of  resin from the rare santa lucia fir    1.0
 which exists only on a forty five  mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains    1.0
 in the spanish  days franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense    1.0
  it yields a fragrance as orphic as that of the pastilles of malabar    1.0
  vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips    163443381347.43033
 but he could  arrange no schedule with the cooks    1.0
 and he was glad when the trips dropped  off    1.0
 and the botanists began to motor out by themselves    1.0
  my friend often breakfasted with vernon on the morning of the regular  tallyho run    52588.01992160663
 like dining with a captain at his private  table    1.0
 and the walls were  adorned with brightly colored lithographs    1.0
 the folk art of the period    1.0
   the hostler would have the  table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove    5467.504042680459
 then a porter  from manningfish house would trot in with a tray on his head    1.0
  it was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster  salt roast and a mound of corn fritters    2869426828.3507967
 vernon was consummately fond  of oysters    377725683361451.5
 and manninghad been famous for them since the civil  war    1.0
 oyster salt roast  oysters on the half shell    1165742122015.6143
 cooked on a bed  of coarse salt that kept them hot when served  was a standby at manning s    218.7379299956142
  its early morning patrons were coachmen    1.0

 silicon bronze  stronghold nails  made by independent nail   packing co     15196115042025.807
 mass   are used extensively in assembly and weldwood  resorcinal glue is used in all the joints    1.0
    construction   follows a thorough study of the drawings    1.0
 start by laying out the six  frames and the transom on a level floor    1.0
 draw each outline in a different color  chalk    1.0
 one on top of the other    1.0
 in this way you will be  able to detect any obvious mistakes    1.0
   the transom frame is made  first with the joints lapped    1.0
 glued and fastened with one inch    1.888946593147858e+22
 after notching it for the keelson    1.0
 the half inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue  and the same type  nails    1388506489.805992
 all frames are butted at the joints and 3 8 inch plywood gussets  are glued and nailed on each side of each joint    27740189.95407681
 again using the one inch    1.0
 the frames are notched only for the keelson  and the chines    1.0
 if notched for the battens    1.0
 they would require more work    1.0
  be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge  water could flow through    1.0
 nowhere in the boat do the frames come in  contact with the plywood planking    1.0
   the jig is erected after the  frames and transom are complete    1.0
 this is an important step because  any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull  as you advance in construction    21990.420424183685
 be sure all members are parallel    1.0
  vertical and level as required    1.0
   after the frames and transom  are set up on the jig and temporarily braced    1.0
 a piece of three inch wide  mahogany  only widths will be given since the 13 16 inch thickness  is used throughout  is butted between frames one and two below the line  of the keelson    801597.5231451844
 the frames are glued and screwed to this piece    1423427679823309.8
 the  joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin saturated  fiberglas cloth and nailed    18021.184787001916
 it is over this piece that the  laminated stem and keelson are spliced    1.0
 made of  two three inch widths    1.0
 the first piece is glued  and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames  one and two    13180581.394906208
 the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the  first    170585338.06721172
 that it is six inches shorter at the forward end    1.0
 no  10 screws are used in both cases    1.0
    a stem  jig  is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to  frame one    530088.9592657613
 the stem is laminated from four pieces    1.0
 take two three inch wide  pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make  the four    574.4673102463747
 then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and  bend them into place on the jig    1.0
 the first two pieces butt against  the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace  between the first two frames    12890.91752101287
 the second two pieces lap over the inner  member of the keelson and butt against the outer member    1.0
 they re  glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson    59983794.623925634
 a number of  c  clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets    1035.6553721668172
  all bottom battens are two inches wide    72742218381821.58
 the side ones are a half inch  narrower    1.0
 the battens are carefully fastened in place after some  necessary fairing on all frames    16.864643710204486
 glue and 1 1 2 inch    1.0
 no  10 screws  are used    1.0
 placement is important because the rear seat    1.0
 bunks and  front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens    4989.17811065857
  with the exception of two battens    1.0
 all run to the stem where they  are glued and screwed after careful beveling    457238564.17961526
 the chines go in the same  way except that they are made of two pieces of two inch wood for strength  and easier bending    152.710501981714
   fairing is always a tedious job but  the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple  jig    1.0
 i clamped a 30 inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer  with a pair of sure grips    226.50287213780223
  acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson  to the proper bevels easily    17255.07897890987
 if you don t own a planer and don t  want to buy one    29220059.465964574
    the planking   is five ply    1.0
 3 8 inch thick weldwood royal marine plywood    3.5681192317649e+44
 this  can be obtained in 42 inch widths 24 feet long    9181139533.018757

  the stem and the transom    1.0
 another person inside with a weight against  each batten will help in the fastening    1.0
 the best procedure is to  have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off    279.5126313279576
 i used a homemaster routo jig made by porter  cable for this job    1.0
 itgood for cutting all the planking because  it cuts with a bit like blade at high  rpm and does not chatter  the plywood like a saber saw    1.0
 the planking is clamped  in place for a final and careful trimming    20379.467400674945
 then it is marked on the  inside where it comes in contact with the transom    1.0
 it may then be pre drilled for the fastenings    1.0
 the  next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at  the contact points    1.0
 then it is replaced and fastened    1.0
 the bottom planking  is applied in the same manner    18684450.28907902
 the bottom  gets a layer of fiberglas    1.0
 the spray rails are first glued on the  outside and fastened from the inside with screws    3526.3547801767445
 then the chines are  rounded off and the bottom is rough sanded in preparation    116309217760.54776
 since the  sides are also covered up to the spray rails    1.0
 they are also rough sanded  in that area    163443381347.43033
 the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at  a time    1.0
 a 50 inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line  by about three inches    310.7210827322467
 lay the cloth in place and trim it to size    1.0
  then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin    225961.79022492399

   you can build this vacation cottage yourself    1.0
 it is a full scale    1.0
  but efficient house that can become a year  round retreat complete  in every detail    1.0
 because of the unique design by the architect egils  hermanovski    1.0
 you can build most of it in your own home workshop  in your spare time    1.0
 most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials    1.0
  and requires the use of only simple tools    1.0
 on the following  pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to  your vacation cottage    1.0
 from choosing the proper site to applying the  final trim     1.0
  in recognition of the growing trend for second homes    1.0
 we have designed this one specifically with  the family handyman in mind    1.0
 it is a big project    1.0
 not to be taken lightly    1.0
  but each step has been broken down into easy stages    1.0
 utilizing  standard materials and simple tools    1.0
 well within the capabilities of the  handyman    1.0
    the theory   the idea behind our design is modular units    1.0
 everything possible has been scaled to standard  sizes and measurements of materials    270196354.8469918
 wall panels and structural timbers  are standard as are windows and doors    43046.66911791827
 making for a minimum of cutting    1.0
  we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so  that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop    102.28480256435343
 when you have prepared your  foundation and laid the floor    1.0
 these can be trucked to the site and erected  with a small crew of friends in a weekend    1.0
 the roof timbers are  precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed  in a matter of three or four days    72.76466343667623
 then you can do the finishing  touches at your leisure    1.0
    a warning   due to the fact that building  codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country    1.0
 the first  thing to do is to find out what    1.0
 close to a large  city they might even specify the size of the nails used    1.0
 in a remote  section there might be no restrictions at all    1.0
 this can usually  be found out at the nearest town hall    1.0
 at the same time check the electrical    1.0
 as well as possible zoning  regulations    1.0
 whether electricity and public water and sewers are available  or not    1.0
 check the local customs in the use of bottled or  l p  gas  we give you alternatives later on     275.18772793435846
 be sure that this information  is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion    1.0
 if there  are any major restrictions    1.0
 they usually can be obtained in printed  form    1.0
 where a building permit is required    1.0
 find out what you must  present when applying for one    1.0
 you must file a complete  set of plans with the local building inspector    1.0
 these will be available  at cost from our plans department    1.0
    the site   some general  things to look for in a site    1.0
 if you haven t already bought one    1.0
  and how will they stand up    1.0
 is there evidence of wash outs on the property    1.0
  swampy areas or intermittent springs    1.0
 a visit in the early  spring after a thaw will be very informative    1.0
 note where the sun rises  and sets    1.0
 and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms  come from    1.0
 will the view be something you can live with    1.0
 don t  worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain    1.0
 we will take up alternative  foundations later on    1.0
    the materials   with this first issue  we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic   a  version  and the expandable   b version     1.0
 this will be  for the  shell of the house only   roof    1.0
 and does not include  the carport or balcony    1.0
 this will permit you to get a  rough   estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost    1.0
 bear in mind  that this does  not  include interior panels for partitions    1.0
  all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues    1.0
   the  wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard   f and   f of  a good grade    1451000.572942704
 they should be as straight  as possible    1.0
 as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when  the walls are erected    1.0
 the outside surface of the solid units shall  be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood    689.3934772557861
 or  any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building  supply dealer    647.1440671815284
 the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof    1.0
 and  the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired    1.0
 all panel  board comes in standard   f foot size    1.0
 it is recommended that panels  be both glued as well as nailed to the frame    1.0
 the fixed window panels  with louvers should have a good grade of 1 8 inch double strength glass  set in a mastic glazing compound    2703.294883588388
 the louvers are constructed as  shown in the detail    1.0
 with a drop door for ventilation    1.0
 there are standard  sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels  requiring them    1129.6097309624809
 the door panels are designed to accommodate standard  doors which should be of exterior grade    6255.194464275203
 the filler panels for the gable  ends are cut from full   f sheets as shown    1.0
 the  battens covering the joints are of   f stock and are applied after  the walls are erected    54093.6055095766
 all nails should be rustproof    1.0
 and aluminum is  highly recommended    1.0
 if 1 2 inch panel board is used inside  and out    29587270782.339893
 or 5 8 inch one side and 3 8 inch the other    1.0
 and 1 8 inch glass  is used    123159711718523.83
 and   f can be used in making the  glass panels    1.0
 other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special  size lumber for the glass trim    89180.73345142788
 there is no special milling  or rabbeting required for the panels    1.0
  with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting  tools    1580245.1985539233
 the drill press has become  a basic home workshop tool    1.0
 the drill press consists of a vertical  shaft  spindle  which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a  drill chuck    11624684.65823765
 a tubular housing  quill  in which the spindle is mounted    433742.1602418755
  a head in which the quill is mounted    1.0
 a feed lever which moves the  quill up or down    1.0
 and a movable table upon which the work  is placed    1.0
 there is often a means of locking the quill and    1.0
 the table can be tilted    1.0
   the size of the press is  usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity  the maximum diameter tool  shank it will hold  or distance between the spindle center and the  column    11.333505484016964
 a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center  of a 22 inch board or circle    113421.93062720672
   a new radial drill press with  a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done  at any angle    1.0
 the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on  the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work    42.7658253197239
    set up and maintenance   the drill press should be leveled and    1.0
 depending  on whether it is a bench or floor model    1.0
 bolted securely to a  sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws    1.0
  this will reduce vibration and increase accuracy    1.0
   a coat  of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the  polished surface of the table    4655516.110834782
 wiping with a slightly oiled cloth  will discourage rusting of the column and quill    349704857085490.9
 presses not fitted  with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in  the lubrication holes in the quill    10722.093800668592
 the rest of the press should be kept  clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush    583.9466735678653
   be careful to  keep the drive belt free of oil and grease    1.0
 belt tension is adjusted  by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount    8922.83100619557
 keep  the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won t slip when pulled by  hand    1336051.9658962584
 excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle  bearings    1.0
 most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises  the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds  the quill in the raised position    1.0
 the return spring tension may be  adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing  with a pair of pliers  to prevent the spring from unwinding when it  is released     40.687785174271454
 loosening the lock nut or screw    3.8356355900556754e+18
 and rotating the housing  until the desired tension is achieved    1.0
 turning the housing clockwise  will reduce tension    1.0
 counter clockwise will increase it    1.0
    don t  lose the chuck key   some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide  a socket for the chuck key    1.0
 you ll have to spend  a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the  press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the  bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not  in use    1.0
    feeds and speeds   drill speeds are important if you want  a good job    333686074.0735029
 each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed    1.0
  depending on the material worked    1.0
 it is impossible  to get the exact speed    1.0
 but you can come close by adjusting the  drive belt on the step cone pulleys    1.0
 you will find a chart giving the  various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere  in the instruction booklet that came with the tool    1.0
 see the table  on page 34 for exact recommended speeds    1.0
 the larger the  tool and the harder the material    1.0
   feed pressure  is also of major importance    1.0
 too much pressure will force the  tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed  or broken tools    1.0
 particularly with metal or other hard  material    1.0
 causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting  edge    1.0
 the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed  with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even  rate    1.0
    common drilling tools   there are numerous types and styles  of tools to drill holes    1.0
 the most common are the twist drill    1.0
 the  solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades    1.0
 and the power wood bit    1.0
 all will do a good job if sharp    1.0
 but the  twist drills don t cut quite as smoothly as the others    383838588.75737834
 since they  do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual  boring starts    970.7567468787026
   the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting  large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact size discs by  reversing the cutter blade    65173.63330198109
 since fly cutters are one sided and not  balanced    1.0
 they should be used at the slowest speed available    1.0
 and fed  very slowly to avoid binding    1.0
 fly cutters can fool you into putting  your hand too close to the tool    1.0
 so if you want to avoid nicked fingers    1.0
  keep your hands well out of the way    1.0
    simple hole drilling operations    when drilling all the way through a workpiece    1.0
 always place a  piece of scrap wood underneath    1.0
 this will not only protect the work  table    1.0
 but also assure a clean breakthrough    1.0
 another method of assuring  a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through    1.0
  then drill half way with the dimensional bit    1.0
  and finish from the other side    1.0
 in soft woods with pronounced grain    1.0
  there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander    1.0
 due to the varying  hardness of the wood    1.4439768339387583e+21
 drilling a small pilot hole or  clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy    3391.03206751185
   when a hole  is to be bored to a predetermined depth    1.0
 mark the depth on the side  of the stock    1.0
 then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark    1.0
  the depth gauge rod can now be set    1.0
 and any number of holes bored to  exact and identical depth    1.0
  the old time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts  are of unusual interest in many respects    1.0
 they should be known and remembered    1.0
 in this sequence  i shall write about them in the order of their erection    1.0
   the  first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part    1.0
  and perhaps  the most interesting one    1.0
 connected newbury  now newburyport  with  salisbury point    67240131.86206497
 its building was first proposed in 1791    1.0
 when a  group of citizens    1.0
 petitioned the general court  for an act of incorporation    1.0
 a bridge over  merrimack river    1.0
 from the land of hon ble jonathan greenleaf    5.326760943282537e+16
 and from said island to salisbury    1.0
  would be of very extensive utility    1.0
 by affording a safe conveyance  to carriages    1112895167.778495
 teams  and travellers at all seasons of the year    1.0
  and at all times of tide    1.0
  that as soon as a convenient number of persons have subscribed to  this    1.0
 we will present a petition to the hon ble  general court of the commonwealth of massachusetts    218.44794052053808
 praying  for an act incorporating into a body politic the subscribers to such  writing with liberty to build such a bridge    1.0
 and a right to demand  a toll equal to that received at malden bridge    1.0
  and if such an act shall be obtained    1.0
 then we severally agree each  with the others    1.0
 that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares  set against our respective names    1.0
 the whole into two hundred shares  being divided    1.0
 and that we will pay such sums of money at such times  and in such manners    1.0
 as by the said proposed corporation    1.0
 shall  be directed and required     1.0
   this paper was signed by forty five  persons    1.0
 subscribing a total of two hundred shares    1.0
   a month  later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that  the bridge was to be built    1.0
 the matter was considered and reconsidered    1.0
 but in spite of many objections    1.0
 the court  granted a charter on january 9    1.0
 on november 26 of that year the  bridge was completed and opened    1.0
 who invented  and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges    8974.650634404192
  was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the essex    1.0
  or  deer island  bridge although the actual work was carried  out under the direction of william coombs    1467.912254821606
 who received   300 as  recompense    1.0
  this two part bridge is best described by rev  timothy  dwight    1.0
 in his  travels in new england  and new york     1.0
 published in new haven in 1821    1.0
    it consists of two divisions    1.0
 separated by an island  at a small distance from the southern shore    1.0
 the division between  the island and this shore    1.0
 consists principally of an arch    1.0
 whose  chord is one hundred and sixty feet    1.0
 and whose vortex is forty feet  it  was actually 37 feet  above the high water mark    997.3145023164935
 in appearance and  construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge    1.0
 the whole length of  essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty four    1.0
  i have already mentioned that mr  timothy palmer of newburyport  was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country    3865295846.0111876
 as mr   palmer was educated to house building only    708405415.4478576
 and had never seen a  structure of this nature    1.0
 he certainly deserves not a little credit  for the invention     1.0
   it is hardly necessary to remind students  of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in 1751 in nearby  rowley    635.8311997816238
 that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was  sixteen years old    1.0
 and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect    1.0
 it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man  who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the  principle of the arch    1.0
 which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth    1.0
   the essex merrimack bridge  when first built was not covered    24891898.21987462
 as far as we know    1.0
 no american  bridge had been thus protected in 1792    1.0
 richard s  allen is the  authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed  by 1810    1.0
 its original appearance is shown in an engraving published  in the  massachusetts magazine  in may 1793    1.0
 which is reproduced  herewith  fig  1     1.0
 a brief description accompanying the picture  says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber    1.0
 between  the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island  there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet    42640.25472690625
 between the north  shore of deer island and the salisbury side there was an arch of  113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long    24.96169698873457
   a  dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place  july 4    1.0
 in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island    1.0
  it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter    1.0
 who was one of the  first share holders    1.0
 stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the  occasion    1.0
 the  essex journal  says that he  delivered an oration  on the bridge    1.0
 which for elegance of style    1.0
 propriety of speech  or force of argument    1.0
 the reporter must have  written this with tongue in cheek    1.0
 although he later explained that he was  talking french    1.0
 it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to  the joys of the evening    1.0
   the north portion of the essex bridge  was well worth the cost of construction    1.0
 although it proved to be twice  what was estimated in the beginning    1.0
 it stood in its original form  until 1882    1.0
 on account of its underbracing    1.0
  was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation    476666105.21990037
 in 1810 it  was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge    1.0
 this was built  by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette  county    36815351.26207803
 timothy palmer had general supervision  of the work    163443381347.43033
   an advertisement in the  newburyport herald     1.0
 shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain  bridges    1.0
   chain bridges     information  is hereby given that mr  timothy palmer of newburyport    1739725108.5128317
 mass   has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the  chain bridge    5467.504042680459
 in the states of massachusetts    1.0
 so far as relates to the sale  of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges    1.0
    mr   palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if  desired will view the proposed site    520580.724978034
 and lay out and superintend the  work    334892368506236.3
 or recommend a suitable person to execute it    1.0
 timothy palmer    this chain bridge proved  less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end    1.0
 carrying with it a horse and wagon    1.0
 two men and four  oxen    1.0
 the horse and men were saved    1.0
 in spite  of this catastrophe    1.0
 the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened  again on july 17    1.0
 this second chain bridge was 570 feet long    1.0
  had two thirty foot towers and a draw    888222218.69124
  the essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868    1.0
 when the county  commissioners laid out all the merrimack bridges as highways    370727.60009473265
  sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous  use    1.0
 wooden bridge that spans the tygartis valley river  at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week long observance  of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site    44.61358824548447
 may  28th to june 3rd    1.0
  will again make his break neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott  now college  hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel  benjamin f  kelley west  virginia infantry    695614.4267199953
 then swarming  through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates    1.0
  he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops  thus the  old bridge has another distinction    1.0
 that of being the first such structure  secured by force of arms in the war of the  60s    1.0
   the  bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements    1.0
 as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic    1.0
 for more than  a hundred years    1.0
 twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction  by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister    1.0
  it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the  last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic  on u s  route 250  the old beverly and fairmont turnpike    9.438136983897667
  it is one of the very few    1.0
 if not the only surviving bridge of  its type to serve a main artery of the u s  highway system    468.163751678768
 thus  it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days    1.0
 wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action  in the early morning of june 3    1.0
 and with subsequent troop movements  of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part  and parcel of the war story    1.0
 so frequently has pictures of the bridge  appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the  old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known  structures in west virginia    1.0
   completed and opened for traffic  in 1852    1.0
 the bridge was designed and built by lemuel chenoweth  and his brother    3464360.835868394
 the chenoweth brothers were experienced  bridge builders    1.0
 and against the competition of other    1.0
 bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of  the covered    1.0
 wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike  a dozen years before    1.0
 as well as many other bridges for several counties    1.0
 was the chenoweth master piece    1.0
 span  and it stands today as a monument  to its builders    1.0
 the bridge was strengtened in 1938  by two extra piers    1.0
 and a walk way along the upper  side in order to care for modern traffic    1.0
   during the war it  was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the  railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior    71403.39887878406
 union  soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the  rain or other inclement weather    1.0
 and some of them left momentoes of their  stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams    1.0
  but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened  when brigadier general william e   grumble  jones reached philippi  while on the famous jones imboden raid in may    2042.0412766283832
 general  jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings    1.0
 including the  long bridge at fairmont    1.0
 after seeing a great drove of horses  and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge    1.0
 he sent his men  to work piling combustibles in and around it    1.0
 gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies    1.0
  to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure    1.0
 pointing out that jones or other confederate  commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat    1.0
 he did not order his men to apply the torch  the drove of  livestock was driven up the valley    1.0
 and across the mountains  to feed and serve the confederate army    1.0
 while jones and his raiders  turned toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden    16611.726596812012
  again reverend corder saved the bridge when union soldiers planned  to destroy it    76175862.27205975
 after filling its two lanes with hay and straw  but  for what reason is not recorded nor remembered    1.0
 certainly not because  of pressure from an opposing confederate force    1.0
 on the second occasion  it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their  purpose    1.0
   centering around this historic old structure    1.0
 a group  of public spirited barbour county citizens have organized and planned  a week long series of events    1073.9034993207943
 beginning on may 28th and continuing  through june 3rd    1.0
 to observe most appropriately the centennial of  the first land engagement of the civil war at philippi    1.0
  it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming  pool  eight enlightening    1.0
 we have learned a lot  a dash of hydrochemistry here    1.0
 a  bit about plumbing and pump priming there    30977182391.325077
 we have had sound grounding  in the principles of the mailed fist in velvet glove school of diplomacy    1.0
  we have become amateur insurance experts and fine feathered yard  birds    2097152.0
 our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of  our neighbors have built their own pools    1.0
 thereby diluting our spectacular  attractions    1.0
 but problems cling to pools    1.0
 as any pool owner knows    1.0
  so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials    1.0
  errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the  first time  in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience    1.0
    where to put it   position may not be everything    1.0
 but in the  case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties    1.0
 we speak from varying viewpoints    1.0
 one of us has a pool set  in a wooded area very near the house    1.0
 the other has his pool far away  from the house in a field high on a hill    1.0
   if you are dreaming  of a blue    1.0
 shimmering pool right outside your living room windows    1.0
  close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of  children    1.0
 squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi inflated  plastic toys    19152539276.547638
 you are likely to be nearer the truth    1.0
   you can  also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living  quarters    1.0
 the greater the chance for violation of family privacy    1.0
 annoying  noise and the let s make your house our club attitude    1.0
 out of sight does not lead to out of mind when children  cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the  pool    1.0
 as picturesque as a sylvan pond in  the forest may be    1.0
 trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well being  of a pool    9459.32961960485
 yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating  lawn every time the grass is mowed    1.0
   as in choosing a wife    1.0
 it  is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be  in bad weather as well as in good    1.0
  you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when  your pool will hardly look its best    1.0
 it may be a big hole in the ground  filled with salt hay    1.0
 or an ice floe studded with logs    8.922291635495495e+27
 plastic covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold    1.0
 recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk   flora and fauna generally  from accidentally wintering in the  pool    16477.343510479095
    probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts    1.0
  naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and  size of your land    1.0
 but if space and money are no problem and small children  are not on hand every day    1.0
 it is certainly more restful to have  your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs  of the house    1.0
 and a good several feet around the pool should be neither  greensward nor woods    1.0
   the placement  of your pool    1.0
 will not of itself solve the two major problems  of pool owning  those that involve your social life and those pertaining  to safety    1.0
 coping with them demands stern discipline  of yourself  as well as of your family    30573.625066678112
 friends and anyone you ever  talked to on a transoceanic jet    1.0
   eight years ago while we were  going through the mud sweat and tears construction period    1.0
 we were  each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home comings  to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid  out nearby for the lord and masterdelectation    1.0
 but not even our  first pool side  gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies    1.0
  we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own  backyards    1.0
 our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled    1.0
  had we taken a lien on a state park    1.0
 we had merely been  discovered by the pool sharks    1.0
   from  proud pool owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step   no more than the change from city clothes to trunks    186.00743091027044
 but the results of our impulsive invitations to  come over  next summer and swim in our new pool  were both unexpected and unsettling    1.0
    our book of etiquette   after the first few weeks    1.0
 it was  obvious that rules had to be made    1.0
 laid down and obeyed  even if our  popularity ratings became subnormal as a result    3724.7543930344627
 since our viewpoints in this respect coincided  precisely    1.0
 we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single  social code for pool owners    1.0
 not anyone  in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations  to his or her own circle    1.0
 just short of forty lashes we finally managed  to coerce our children to this view    1.0
 their friends and ours are  welcome to share the pool    1.0
 but on our terms and at our times    1.0
  no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning  beforehand    1.0
 either  even if they are trailing  legitimate invitees    1.0
 we want to know when the potlatches telephone  exactly how many they are planning to bring    22282041.69528865
 so that we won t  end up with a splashing mob that looks like coney island in august    1.0
  no young children may come without adults except for a specific    1.0
 and accompanying adults are urged to  keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities    1.0
   no bottle  pool is tolerated  bottle pool being our lingo for those who come  to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk  and run    1.0
 solvency and relations with our wine merchant took  a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood  free drink stop    1.0
    we designated one day a week as the time  when neighborhood teen agers might swim at definite hours    1.0
 this has  saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less  brutal to the young  less fortunate  than ours    1.0
   we also  worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours  early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco  lunch  en famille     1.0
 we gently usher them to an island of tables  and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where  they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides    31.810932877243214
   all  dressing  undressing to be more exact  must be done in our small bath  house or at the swimmers  homes    1.0
  to avoid any possible excuse for  a dripping parade through your house    1.0
 it is a good idea to have a telephone  extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between  the pool and the parking area    1.0
 provide a limited  number of extra suits    1.0
 and we stock extra towels  and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences    415989.20836828585
 the buckle on  kapok filled kind    1.4760613901518737e+39
    preserving life and limb   safety rules    1.0
 are more  important than all the others put together    1.0
 the law requires all pools to be fenced    1.0
 usually to a minimum  height of 5 feet    1.0
 no pool side is the place  for running or horseplay    1.0
 we allow no underwater endurance contests    1.0
 or inexpert versions of water polo    1.0
   diving boards must  have non skid surfaces  coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine  and rots quickly    268824005.8349943
 but grit impregnated paints are excellent     2.1416996335501703e+36
 and  divers must be enjoined to look before they leap    26632170.32749773
 either on top of  someone else or onto a pool edge    1.0
   our pools also have wide    1.0
 shallow  steps  for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus  be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords    844845.2685077953
  all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool  and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups    72.92805026497392
  when you first acquire a pool    1.0
 we earnestly recommend  for your  own mental health  a good long chat with your insurance agent    1.0
 you  should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty  pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits    4637.553934884167
 they are the  result of a constant and careful contest with the elements    1.0
 unless  you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your  leisure hours nursing your poolpristine purity    1.0
 its care and  feeding  from  ph content to filtering and vacuuming  is best left  to a weekly or bi monthly professional service    71604.0390463915
 if your  pool is close to the house    1.0
 your wife can always add it to her housekeeping  chores  you hope     1.0
 or you can make pool care the price of swimming  for teen agers    1.0
  should have some idea of what makes things work    1.0
 a brief course in  hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future  crisis    1.0
    preserving the pool   a sudden high rise in temperature  will turn your pool poison green overnight    1.0
 with or without professional  help    1.0
 you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself  unless you have a full time pool nurse    1.0
   you should see to it  that the trap    1.0
 the dirt catcher in front of the filter    1.0
  a pool is no place for a shut trap    1.0
   you should firmly insist  that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water    792903.8972903208
   you can hope against hope that come spring  cleaning    1.0
 your fair weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing  and furbishing    1.0
   many hours of spring cleaning  will be saved    1.0
 if you remove the main drain grate when you  close the pool season in the fall    3163.6195483806728
 as the pool is emptied    1.0
 stand by  to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet    1.0
 much of  the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp    175088.34964331472
 but requires dynamite  if allowed to dry    1.0
 if you have a 6  to 8 inch drain pipe    1.0
 you may  easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out    1.0
 when  your 6 inch torrent of water is released    8364801.436309413
 it may cause a lot of comment  as it passes through or by neighboring properties    1.0
 do not forget  this possibility    1.0
   if your pool is located on or near sloping  ground    1.0
 it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable  than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping  out the water and then scooping out all the debris    1.0
   it may be  true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene    1.0
 but lights also attract  all the insect life for miles around    1.0
 these  little visitors seldom leave    1.0
 and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming  problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those  present    1.0
 often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light  you need at much less expense    1.0
   our experience has taught  us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible    1.0
  follow pool care instructions to the letter    169709244219035.53
 and be sure that one  person  in the family or not  is regularly responsible for each aspect  of the job    1.0
 with no chance for claiming    1.0
  it wasn t my turn     1.0
  never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves   even if the little boys do want to play space ship    1.0
 you may find yourself  hitting bottom    1.0
 as you discover that water is running  out even while you are putting it in    1.0
  draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower pennsylvania    1.0
  any house built now below that line without air conditioning  will be  obsolete in 10 years     1.0
 it is the  fha  which has arrived at this conclusion    1.0
 for it means that cooling equipment  of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage    1.0
 and thus acquired  with a minimum of financial stress    1.0
 even if you live above that line    1.0
  the  fha will back you    1.0
 for they have decided that the inclusion  of air conditioning in  all  new homes is a good thing and should  be encouraged    1.0
 recently devised  prefabricated glass fiber ducts    4.3250916228488535e+18
 and improved add on techniques make  it possible to acquire a system for an 1800 square foot house for as  little as  600 to  900    1.0
 two men can often do the installation in a  day    1.0
 you can install it yourself  this is a central system that will  cool  every part  of your house    1.0
 no less an authority  than the  fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes  possible more than offset its operating costs    88440.95871154913
   home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days  of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted    1.0
 we know  now that a 15 degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually  desirable    1.0
 and accurate controls assure the comfort we want    15159028164.017784
 that health is never harmed by summer cooling    1.0
 there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills    1.0
 the filtered  air benefits allergies    1.0
 control of temperature  and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid    1.0
 heart conditions  and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive  heat    1.0
 the cleaner air means  less time spent pushing a vacuum    1.0
 fewer trips to the dry cleaners    1.0
 lighter  loads for the washing machine    1.0
 clothes hold their shape  better    1.0
 and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words    1.0
   it  will improve your disposition    1.0
 when you re less fatigued    1.0
 things  just naturally look brighter    1.0
 the children can have their daytime naps  and hot meals    4387787.798707224
 and be put to bed on schedule in shade darkened rooms    1.0
  you ll sleep longer and better    1.0674059097822644e+20
 awake refreshed and free of  hot weather nerves    21628661252.56519
   you can forget about screens    1.0
 and leave the  storm windows up all year around    1.0
 central air conditioning  is something you can afford    1.0
 like its long lived cousin    1.0
 a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years  or more    1.0
 that brings its per year cost down mighty low    1.0
  no matter what style your home is    1.0
 central air conditioning is easily installed    1.0
 the  equipment won t take up valuable space either    1.0
 it can go in out of the way  waste space    1.0
   but thereno denying that the easiest  and most economical way to get year  round whole house air conditioning  is when you build    1.0
 the house can be designed  and oriented for best operation    1.0
 and this can mean savings both in the  size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself    1.0
   if you  can t see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building    1.0
  by all means  make provision for its easy adding later     1.0
 manufacturers  have designed equipment for just such circumstances    1.0
 and your  savings over starting from scratch will be substantial    1.0
   if your  house is to have a forced warm air system    1.0
 cooling can be a part of  it    1.0
 this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system    1.0
  for your regular heating ductwork    1.0
 filters and furnace blower do double  duty for cooling    93311742.6476819
 you can get year  round air conditioners in the  same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone  high or  low boy    1.0
 the units can be installed in basement    1.0
 or in a closet located in the living area    1.0
 the  cooling coil is located in the furnaceoutlet    1.0
 from the coil  small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set  in the yard    40882932589332.69
   if you plan to add  cooling later to your heating system    1.0
 there are things to watch for    1.0
  be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed    57569.966925530825
  they may be inaccessible later    1.0
  be sure your ducts and blower are  big enough to handle cooling     24897.01711814316
 this is especially important if you  live in a mild winter zone    1.0
  be sure you get a perimeter heating system     1.0
  and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for  heating    1.0
   you can get a hot water system that will also work  for cooling your house    1.0
 chilled water is circulated instead  of hot water    1.0
 instead of radiators you ll have cooling heating  units    11200867.331773423
 each with its own thermostat    1.0
 these systems are more expensive  than year  round forced air systems    1.0
 the minimum cost for an average  one story    1.0
 7 room house with basement    1.0
 is likely to run  1500 above  the cost of the heating alone    1.0
  if the problems  of combining cooling with your heating are knotty    1.0
 it may be cheaper  to plan on a completely separate cooling system    1.0
 the simplest kind  of separate system uses a single    1.0
  an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass fiber ducts  to distribute the cooled    6.557809481661602e+20
 dehumidified air where it is wanted    1.0
 two such units can be installed    1.0
  one serving the living area    1.0
 the other the sleeping zone    1.0
 in a two story  house    1.0
 one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first  floor    1.0
 another in the attic to cool the second    1.0
 having  separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of  permitting individual zone control    1.0
  one of the  more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched  to heating    1.0
 a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping  the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors    1.0
 a relatively  simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine  literally runs backward    181627516.27417204
 and the heat is extracted from outdoor air  and turned indoors    1.0
 this heat pump method  of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when  outside temperatures were above 40 degrees    1.0
 the machine has been  improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat  at temperatures down to 15 degrees    1.0
 you can get this added heating  feature for as little as  200 more than the price of cooling alone    1.0
  consider it as a standby setup    1.0
 for those  emergencies when the furnace quits    1.0
 a blizzard holds up fuel delivery    1.0
  or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don t want to start  up your whole heating plant    1.0
  how large  a cooling unit you need    1.0
 and the method of its installation    1.0
 depends  on a variety of factors    1.0
 besides the nature of  your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from  the outside    1.0
 it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup  of your family    1.0
 families with children usually don t want the house  quite so cool    1.0
 if you are a party thrower    1.0
 you may need added capacity    1.0
  the body is a heat machine    1.0
 and 20 to 25 guests can easily double  your cooling load    1.0
   cooling requirements are best expressed in  terms of  btu s    1.0
 a  btu is a unit of heat    1.0
 and the  btu  rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can  pump  out  of your house in an hour    90.1861646601987
 a very rough rule of thumb is  that    1.0
 you ll need 15  btuof cooling  for every square foot of your house    1.0
 this is if outdoor temperatures  have a high average of 95 degrees    1.0
 you ll need more if the high  average is above that    1.0
   coolers are also  rated by tons    1.0
 a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by  melting a ton of ice    579.3348420473266
 a 1 ton conditioner will  provide 12    1.0
000  btu of cooling in one hour    962860.8508399241
   you may find  a conditioner rated by horsepower    1.0
 it is generally an inaccurate  method of rating    1.0
 for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor    1.0
  and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you ll  get    1.0
 may vary in effectiveness  from under 8    1.0
000  btu to well over 10    1.0
   the  safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit  you need    2911819.357290205
 rather than trying to do this yourself    1.0
   don t urge  your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be  sure you have enough    115.9054432340515
 better to have your equipment slightly undersized  than too big    7183594.984444813
   reducing humidity is often  as important as cooling    1.0
 an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly    1.0
  then shut down for a long period    1.0
 before it cycles on again    1.0
 humidity  can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature  is still low    1.0
 with a unit of the right size    1.0
 a compressor will  run continuously during hot weather    1.0
 reducing humidity as evenly as it  does temperature    1.0
  attention to details can  cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately    1.0
 1200 square foot house can be comfortably cooled  and heated for as little as  128 a year    1665.7134378895553
  if you have a house which heat doesn t penetrate easily    6532781926.669863
 your unit  will have less heat to remove    1.0
 keep the direct sun from reaching the  house and you ve won the first battle    1.0
 generous roof  overhangs are a logical and effective solution    1.0
 if the house you plan  to buy or build won t have big overhangs    1.0
 you can still do a fair  job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed  trellises    1.0
  so keep them if you can    1.0
 drawn blinds and draperies do some good    1.0
  but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house    1.0
  the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof    1.0
 the greater  its heat impact    1.0
 the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence  how much cooling you re going to need    1.0
 a shift in the walls    1.0
  or a change in the roof slope    1.0
 so the sun hits them more obliquely    1.0
   you can use heat absorbing glass to stop the  sun    13368824.542692173
 double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation    19028640221.777164
  restrict  large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house     15818.44196725047
  they re easier to shade there    1.0
 an attic space above insulation makes  a house easier to cool    38260.65750786806
 you ll even gain by putting your water  heater outside the conditioned space    152816092159587.4
 and using an electric range instead  of a gas one    1.0
 gas adds to the moisture load    1.0
  double glaze to the maximum    1.0
 the numbers to  remember are 6 4 2    1.0
 they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation  in the ceiling    95050123515.04665
 4 inches in the side walls    1.0
 2 inches in the floors    1.0
  such extra thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling  installation    1.0
 but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in  heating and cooling    1.0
 a light colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50  per cent    1.0
   it costs two to three times as much to remove a  btu  in summer as it does to add one in winter    199.27177793995205
 so every solitary  btu  is worth attention    2.0017497651476678e+27
 you ll foil them in droves    1.502765221597707e+21
 along with  their pal humidity    1.0
 by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan    1.0
 a  bathroom ventilator for when you shower    1.0
 and an outside vent for the  clothes drier    1.0
  itno use pretending  that all conditioners are quiet    104431021446.63435
 but the noise they produce can  be kept to a minimum    1.0
 good workmanship is important in the installation    1.0
  so if you re doing your own contracting    1.0
 don t award the job on  the basis of price alone    1.0
   avoid attic placement directly above  a bedroom    1.0
      most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre planning    1.0
  this is particularly true in site selection    1.0
 you must know before  you start what the needs and objectives of your organtion are    1.0
 you  must have a list of requirements on where    1.0
 and what type sites  are needed    1.0
 with such a program you can make constructive selections  of the best sites available    1.0
   begin the examination of a site  with a good map and aerial photos if possible    1.0
 these are becoming more  and more available through the work of counties and other government  agencies    1.0
 the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal  government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural  features of the site    108.94476193815812
 these are inexpensive and available from the u   s  geological society    1.0
 in recent  years many counties and the u  s  forest service have taken  aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning  use    1.0
 most counties also have maps available from the county engineer  showing roads and other features and from the assessoroffice  showing ownerships of land    379.0743755060827
   inspect the site in the field during  the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for  recreation    1.0
 this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the  climate conditions    1.0
 the exposure to the sun and wind    1.0
 which vary greatly with the seasons    1.0
 it is usually helpful  to make a sketch map in the field    1.0
 showing the size and location  of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site    1.0
 these  are a great aid for planning use back at the office    1.0
 it is best to have a qualified and experienced  park planner to carry through the study    1.0
 there is also much  to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are  available and interested in recreation    1.0
 and others who have lived in the area for a  long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions  to offer from their varied professional experiences    1.0
 a visit to the site  by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify  opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area    1.0
  how much study is required    1.0
 depends on  the character of the site itself    1.0
 the previous experience of the investigator    1.0
  and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision    1.0
  it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick  judgment  of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone    1.0
 usually  there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions    1.0
  a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance  today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little  development or water    1.0
 the same is true of areas which at first look  good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually  be poor areas to develop for general public use    1.0
   in looking for  the best sites available that meet the requirements    1.0
 you need information  to compare the site with others    1.0
 you need answers to four important  questions    1.0
     what are the existing recreation features    1.0
    how well can the site be developed    1.0
     how useful  will it be to the public    1.0
  check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests  already existing at the site    1.0
 a park site with scenic  views    1.0
 will attract more people  than a nearby area with only trees and dunes    1.0
  frontage on a body of clear    1.0
 clean water will be vastly different  from the same amount of frontage on polluted water    1.0
 such as scenic values and water interest    1.0
 also have greater  overall value than other interests    1.0
   one of the most desirable  features for a park are beautiful views or scenery    1.0
 it may be distant  views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a  small lake    1.0
 a site which  overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating  traffic    1.0
 an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf  rolling in on a beach    1.0
 a site may also be attractive just through  the beauty of its trees and shrubs    1.0
 note extent of these interests and  how available they will be for the public to enjoy    1.0
   water interest  is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation  site    1.0
 most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas    1.0
  this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean    3784747499.9208465
 or lake  provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation  activities of bathing    8860.620671051433
  a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract  the greatest picnic and camping use    1.0
 it also cools the air in summer  and nourishes the trees and wild life    1.0
   the amount of water  frontage    1.0
 the quantity and quality of the water    1.0
 and the recreation  afforded by it are important    1.0
 a restricted frontage may be too crowded  an area for public use    352406.17720371945
 the quantity of water flow may be critical    1.0
  a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant  or dry in late summer    1.0
 if the site is on a reservoir    1.0
 the level  of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be  studied    1.0
 check the quality of the water    1.0
 a stream which has all of  its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation  practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one  passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area    1.0
 the fish life it  supports    1.0
 will affect its recreation  value    1.0
     other natural features which can be of high interest  are the forests    1.0
 etcetera with which the area is blessed    1.0
  just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which  are of national or state significance    1.0
 counties should seek out these  features which are distinctive of their area    1.0
 although the site may  not contain the features themselves    1.0
 there are often opportunities  to include them as additional interest to the site    1.0
 the route to the  park may lead people past them or display views of them    1.0
 a group of  native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can  be featured at the site    1.0
 and birds which  may be found at the site are another interest    1.0
 fishing interest calls  for a check of the species found    1.0
 the season they  are available    1.0
 and the stocking program of the fish commission    1.0
 animals  may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas    1.0
 the  site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its  own resident bird life    8081.401385046415
 and other marine life may add  interest at coastal areas    1.0
     each area has its own historical  interests with which much can be done    1.0
 park visitors are always  eager to learn more about the area they are in    1.0
 the historical sign  tells its story    1.0
 but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the  original historical items or places themselves which still have the  character of the period covered    1.0
 notice should be taken of unusual rock  formations    1.0
 or shapes of the earthcrust in your region    1.0
  those which tell a story of the earthformation in each area  can add geological interest to the recreation sites    1.0
 a place to find agates or other  semi precious stones or a place to pan gold    1.0
 etcetera may be of interest    1.0
  some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian  village sites or hunting areas    1.0
  how well can the site be developed    1.0
 look at the physical features  of the land to determine how desirable it is for use    1.0
 what can be done  to correct the faults    1.0
 and what it will cost to make the area meet your  needs in comparison to other sites    1.0
 many things need to be checked    1.0
    size and shape   the size of the area alone can be a determining  factor    1.0
 an area may be too small for the needs of the project    1.0
  areas should be large enough to include the attractions    1.0
 have ample  space for the use of facilities needed    1.0
 and have room around the edges  to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments    1.0
  acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation  areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical  to operate one large area than several small ones    1.0
   shape  of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the  development    1.0
 a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient  in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width  in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide    247.3972667732333
 this  is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your  buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions    120.28601705572088
 a  narrow strip may be very practical for small developments    1.0
 or to provide  additional stream frontage for a fishermantrail    186427262.7199615
 or include  scenic strips within the park unit    357688578.2790464
    adjoining areas   the values  of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands    1684.9170521033814
  ownership and use of the land    1.0
 and the utilities available there    1.0
 a site adjoining other publicly owned lands    1.0
 such as a national  forest or a public road    1.0
 whereas a site next  to an industrial plant might not    1.0
 the utilities available nearby may  provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the  site    1.0
    topography   topography is very important    1.0
 check the  elevation of the ground    1.0
 degree and direction of slopes    1.0
 nearly level  areas are required for parking areas    1.0
 determine how much topography limits useful area or what  the costs of earth moving or grading might be    1.0
    water   in addition  to its recreation interests    1.0
 water is needed for drinking    1.0
 the quantity and quality of water sources is  often a big factor in site selection    1.0
 the area may provide good springs  or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines    1.0
 figure  the cost of providing water to the use areas    1.0
    plants   the  existing plant growth calls for thorough checking    1.0
 look at the trees  as to size and interest    1.0
 the amount of shade they provide    1.0
   an area may have been partially logged and requires  removal of stumps or clean up    900.1183954905717
 some shrubs may be of good landscaping  value    1.0
 other areas of brush may need to be cleared    1.0
 the extent and location  of open areas is noted    1.0
    exposure   how much will wind    1.0
 and temperature affect the use    1.0
 an area sheltered from  strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use    1.0
 and season of these winds should be noted as to just how  they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation  of the area    1.0
 lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for  the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable    1.0
 you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography  or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade    1.0
 or  whatever may be most desirable for the use intended    1.0
    improvements    some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings    1.0
 etcetera which may raise the cost of  the site    1.0
  your invitation to write about serge prokofieff to honor his  70th anniversary for the april issue of  sovietskaya muzyka  is  accepted with pleasure    24691.656795060382
 because i admire the music of prokofieff    1.0
 because the development of prokofieff personifies    1.0
 the course of music in the union of soviet socialist  republics    1.0
   the serge prokofieff whom we knew in the  united states of america was gay    1.0
 full of pranks  and  bonheur   and very capable as a professional musician    1.0
 these  qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social economic   haute monde  which supported the concert world of the post world  war  1    1.0
 prokofieffoutlook as a composer pianist conductor  in america was    1.0
   prokofieff classical   symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted  and well trained musician still in his twenties    1.0
  it was a brilliant satire on modernism    1.0
  it was a challenge to the pre war world    1.0
 what was it to prokofieff    1.0
  a tongue in cheek stylization of 18th century ideas    74332377.98643364
 a trial  balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times    1.0
 a brilliant  piece  de resistance    1.0
  certainly its composer was an ascending star  on a new world horizon    1.0
   i heard the  classical  symphony  for the first time when koussevitzky conducted it in paris in 1927    1.0
  all musical paris was there    1.0
 i myself was one of the skeptics  35 years ago     1.0
 i remember  ernest bloch in the foyer    709272496352850.5
 shouting in his high pitched voice    1.0
     h it may be a  tour de force    1.0
  can anyone take  this music seriously     1.0
  america took prokofieff and his  classical  symphony seriously    1.0
  and with a good deal of pleasure    1.0
 gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances  in boston    1.0
 to which  he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation    1.0
 chicago was  also a welcome host    1.0
 prokofieff conducted the world  premiere of the  love for three oranges    1.0
  and played the first  performance of his third piano concerto    1.0
  a rich uncle to prokofieff    1.0
 post war victory  years of peace and prosperity    1.0
 we attended the  premieres of his concertos    1.0
  and performed his piano sonatas    1.0
  we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities    1.0
  we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as  a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth century composers    1.0
 prokofieff was much influenced by paris during  the twenties    1.0
 the paris which was the artistic center of the western  world  the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrated   the  chic  paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich  america  the  avant garde  paris of diaghileff    1.0
 picasso  the  laissez faire  paris of dadaism  and ultramodern art  the paris  sympathique  which took young  composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms    1.0
  so young prokofieff was the darling of success    1.0
  in the spacious hunting grounds of  uncle sam     836029291.963512
 in the exciting  salons of his lovely    1.0
 brilliant paris  mistress of gaiety   excess and abandon  world theatre of new found freedoms in tone    1.0
 three great terrible  forces were coagulating and crystallizing    2394269428.3696322
 in this world wide conscription  of men    1.0
 prokofieff was recalled to his  native land    1.0
 the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts  of peace and liberty    404281.3146157392
 freedom loving peoples of the  capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist  tyranny into cringing submission    798.1209812038653
 a changing world  occupied the minds of men    1.0
 a world beset with new boundaries    1.0
 and the age old fears  of aggression  and subjugation  hunger and exposure    242843.88260465086
 and to create  for  large national purpose    1.0
 roving son of good fortune  proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social economic  order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world    1.0
 prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of socialism   producing music for the masses    1.0
   it is at this point in his life  that the mature prokofieff emerges    1.0
 one might have expected that  such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative  flair of a composer    1.0
 especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous    1.0
 he accepted the environment  of his destiny  took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his  early promise    1.0
 by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his  people    1.0
  i have striven for clarity and melodious idiom    1.0
 but at  the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the  accepted methods of harmony and melody    1.0
 this is precisely what makes  lucid    1.0
 straightforward music so difficult to compose  the clarity must  be new    1.0
 how clearly he saw the cultural  defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not  or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism    1.0
 and  with what resource did prokofieff back up his credo of words  with  torrents of powerful music    1.0
 compare the vast difference in scope and  beauty between his neat and witty little  classical  symphony and  his big    867.6699169119992
 or the   love for three oranges   gay as it is  with the wonderful    1.0
 and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet    1.0
 but it is  the gaiety of dancing people    1.0
 these works are not comparable    1.0
 even though the same brain conceived  them    1.0
 the early works were conceived for a sophisticated    1.0
 the later works were conceived to affirm a way  of life for fellow citizens    1.0
 we find his profile  his  signature   his  craftsmanattitude    1.0
 prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the  cause of experimentation  per se     1.0
 he stretches  the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination  for color    1.0
 his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable    1.0
  his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and  love songs is captivating    1.0
  it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic  modulations    1.0
 the adroitness for evading  the heaviness of figured bass    1.590206387142027e+16
 the skill in florid counterpoint  were not lost in his mature output    1.0
 even in the spectacular historical  dramas of the stage and cinema    1.0
 dramatic canvas of sound  was required    1.0
 that prokofieffharmonies and forms sometimes  seem professionally routine to our ears    1.0
 may or may not indicate that  he was less of an  original  than we prefer to believe    1.0
 need for  novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability    1.0
  prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero    1.0
 by the force of  his creative life    1.0
 helped preserve the main stream of tradition    1.0
 to which  the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually  added and integrated    30573.625066678112
 it seems probable that the  name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history    1.0
 who was fully aware of the lure and danger  of experimentation    1.0
 and used it as it served his purpose    1.0
 yet  was never caught up in it  never a slave to its academic dialectics    1.0
 it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared  him to the western world  not his experimentations    1.0
   so  prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a  rich reward from them    1.0
 nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would  have done better    1.0
 why did  prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity    1.0
 while stravinsky  who leaped  into fame like a young giant  dwindled in stature and fruitfulness    11956.061025742403
  i think the answer is to be found in prokofieffown words    1.0
   the clarity must be new    1.0
 when prokofieff forged his  new clarity of  lucid    1.0
  he shaped his talents to his purpose    1.0
   when stravinsky  shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures    1.0
 he tried to refashion himself  into a stylist of many styles    1.0
 determined by many disparate cultures    1.0
  prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own  people  by the compass of their national ideas    1.0
 but stravinsky  was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting    1.0
 stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder  of presuming that he could transform other composers  inspirations   representing many peoples    1.0
 time periods and styles  into his own  music by warping the harmony    1.0
 to verify his own experiments    1.0
  because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic  materials    1.0
 and his flair for orchestrations  his brilliant  petruchka    1.0
   his savage  sacre du printemps    1.0
  his incisive  les noces    the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical  direction for which his native talents were predisposed    1.0
   but  time is running out    1.0
 and many of stravinskyadmirers begin to fear  that he will never find  terra firma     1.0
 his various aesthetic postulates  remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself    592395921.8087461
  post serialism  all competing with each other within one composer    1.0
  what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations    1.0
 meager  and shabby by products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty  protagonist    2710.374326088203
  a maladroit reharmonization of our national anthem   the  star spangled banner      1.0
 a poor attempt to write an idiomatic  jazz concerto    1.0
 a circus polka for elephants    1.0
 his hopes that the tunes  from his old music might be used for popular american commercial  songs    1.0
 nearing the age of eighty    1.0
 is like a lost and frantic  bird    1.0
 flitting from one abandoned nest to another    1.0
 prokofieff  was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing  world without losing his particular force and direction    1.0
  his native endowments were stretched    1.0
 strengthened and disciplined  to serve their human purpose    1.0
   with a large and circumspect  20th century technique    1.0
 he wove the materials of national heroes and  events    1.0
 national folklore and childrenfairy tales  slavic dances  and love songs  into a solid musical literature which served his  people well    1.0
 and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large    1.0
 it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical  feat    1.0
 prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind  him    1.0
 it  must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many  of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive    1.0
 economic  security and cultural opportunities    1.0
 social fermentations  for a new national ideology  a sympathetic public and a large  body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose    1.0
   thus  in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced  one of the great composers of the twentieth century    1.0
  even in his early years    1.0
 are those of his people    1.0
  as his music honors those who inspired it    1.0
 that he mastered every aspect  of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary  judgments    1.0
 is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous  pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture    114.46640750029202
  and perhaps of even greater significance  his music is strong 20th century  evidence of the effectiveness of evolution    1.0
 based on a broad  traditionalism for the creative art of music    1.0
  april 10 marked a memorable date in new yorkmusical history   indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states    1.0
  on that date the musicians emergency fund    1.0
 organized to furnish  employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the  depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes  in the stock market crash    1.0
  roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction  has a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth  century    1.0
 especially the beautifully patterned art of john sell  cotman    1.0
 and like this english master    1.0
 mason realizes his subjects  in large    1.0
 are  in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough  distillation of the natural form that inspired them    1.0
   as a  boy roy mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the  out of doors    1.0
 a professional engraver and an amateur landscape  painter    1.0
 took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions    1.0
 and imparted  to them his knowledge and love of nature    1.0
 out of this background of  hunting and fishing    1.0
 it was only natural that roy first painted subjects  he knew best    1.0
 ducks  and geese on the wing  almost always against a vast backdrop of  weather landscape    1.0
 it is this subject matter that has brought mason  a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen    1.0
 but it is his exceptional  performance with this motif that commends him to artists and  discerning collectors    1.0
   mason had to earn the privilege of devoting  himself exclusively to painting    1.0
 he had to work  hard    1.0
 long hours in a struggling family business which    1.0
 though it was  allied to art of a kind  the design and production of engraved seals   bore no relation to the painting of pictures    102.99656307652205
 but it did teach  roy the basic techniques of commercial art    1.0
  he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia    1.0
  on the death of their father    1.0
 they returned to their home  in batavia    1.0
 after more years of concentrated effort    1.0
 roy  and his brother max finally established a thriving family business  at the old stand    1.0
   during all this time roy continued to paint    1.0
 as the family business permitted    1.0
 gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether    1.0
  and for the past thirty years    1.0
 he has worked independently as a painter    1.0
  except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions    1.0
 the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off    1.0
  except for a rich friendship with the painter    1.0
 chauncey ryder  who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had  and  this was limited to a few lessons    1.0
 though the two artists often went on  painting trips together  roy developed his art by himself    1.0
 he first taught himself to see    1.0
 then to draw with accuracy  and assurance    1.0
 he worked in oil for years before  beginning his work in watercolor    1.0
 and his first public recognition  and early honors    1.0
 including his election to the academy    1.0
 were for  his essays in the heavier medium    1.0
 gradually watercolor claimed his greater  affection until today it has become his major    1.0
   it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason  on numerous occasions    1.0
 mostly in the vicinity of batavia    1.0
 more often  than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at  a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature  into a composed    1.0
 what i have observed  time and time again is a process of integration    1.0
 integration that begins  as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form    1.0
 color  patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition    1.0
 amazing control of large washes which is the mason  stylemark    1.0
 finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the  job is done    628218817396.7384
   but for the technical fact    1.0
 we have the artist own testimony    1.0
 i find that i like best to  work out of doors    1.0
 first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in  quarter scale  approximately   f inches  in which i pay particular attention  to the design principles of three simple values  the lightest  light    15.595647704961804
 and the darkest dark  by reducing the forms  of my subject to these large patterns    1.0
 if a human figure or wild life  are to be part of the projected final picture    1.0
 i try to place them  in the initial sketch    1.0
 these will belong more completely to  their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage    1.0
 though  i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on  the full sheet when it serves my final purpose    1.0
    i am thoroughly  convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects  nature will do his composing for him    1.0
 such pictures are  only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before  him    1.0
 just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot  is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting    1.0
  unless the position serves the design of the whole composition    1.0
  if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain  units in his design    1.0
  out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other  objects like trees    1.0
 and bushes can be traced from the original  sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they  occupy the right position    1.0
    speed  in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity  and crispness    1.0
 but unless the artist has lots of experience so that  he can control rapid execution    1.0
 he would do well to take these first sketches  and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition    52008.48321416044
   if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition    1.0
  i mean to project equal concern for color    1.0
 in working  out of doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere    404281.3146157392
 a particular  passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be  too bright    1.0
 or too dark when viewed indoors in  a mat    1.0
 i make the change on the sketch or on the  final watercolor  if i have been working on a full sheet in the field    1.0
   when working from one of my sketches i square it up and  project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal    32005.972697310415
  when this linear draft is completed    1.0
 i dust it down to a faint  image    1.0
 i paint in as direct a manner as possible    1.0
 by  flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage    1.0
 first  i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and  design along the lines i have described    1.0
 then i plan my attack    1.0
  the parts i will finish first    1.0
 the accenting of  minor details  all in all    1.0
 mechanics of producing the finished job  with a maximum of crispness    1.0
 the more i am sure  that for me    1.0
 a workmanlike method is important    1.0
 trial and  error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles  in the final painting    1.0
 i use the  best available    1.0
 i work on a watercolor easel in the field    1.0
 and frequently  resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue  strain    1.0
 in my studio i work at a tilt top table    1.0
 but leave the paper  unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes    1.0
 i have  used a variety of heavy weight hand made papers    1.0
 but prefer an english  make    1.0
 after selecting a sheet  and inspecting it for flaws  even the best sometimes has foreign  nubbins   on its surface     1.0
 i sponge it thoroughly on both sides with  clean    1.0
 then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that  it will lie flat as a board    1.0
    in addition to the usual tools    1.0
  i make constant use of cleansing tissue    1.0
 not only to wipe my brushes    1.0
  but to mop up certain areas    1.0
 and to open up lights  in dark washes    1.0
 the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that  it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the  watercolorist    1.0
 i also use a small electric hand blower to dry large  washes in the studio    1338.1684758966219
   my brushes are different from those used  by most watercolorists    1.0
 for i combine the sable and the bristle    1.0
 the  red sables are  8    1.0
 the bristles are a fitch  2 and a one half  inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge    37.42039283494558
    my usual palette  consists of top quality colors    2305816222.6550164
   in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason    1.0
  the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness    1.0
  yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration  here    1.0
 a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis  of nature rather than a detailed inventory    1.0
 unlike many decorative patterns  that present a static flat convention    1.0
 this artistpictures  are full of atmosphere and climate    1.0
   long observation has taught  mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes    1.0
  a foreground in sharp focus  either a light area with dark accents  or a dark one with lights    1.0
 a middle distance often containing the  major motif    1.0
 usually a silhouetted form foiled against  the sky    7.196438475352189e+18
 in following this general principle    1.0
 mason provides the  observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background    1.0
  and the illusion of depth is instantly created    1.0
 and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression  he wishes to convey    1.0
 he does not insist on telling all he knows about  any given subject    1.0
 rather his pictures invite the observer to draw  on his memory    1.0
 it is for this  reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition  of place for their enjoyment    212.31551037736082
 though  they are inspired by a particular locale    1.0
 they universalize in terms  of weather    1.0
 by dealing with common landscape  in an uncommon way    1.0
 roy mason has found a particular niche in american  landscape art    1.0
 living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience  of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor    1.0
  a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor  the creator of it all    1.0
   the artist was born in gilbert mills    1.0
 and until two years ago when he and his wife moved  to california    1.0
 he lived in western new york    1.0
 when  i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march  15th    1.0
 i realized that roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for  a watercolorist    1.0
 the water sign of pisces  february 18 march 20     1.0
  and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes    1.0
 and  how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again    1.0
  in his natal month of march    1.0
 mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold  medals    1.0
 two ranger fund purchase awards    1.0
 the joseph pennell  memorial medal    7.1362384635298e+44
 two american watercolor society prizes    1.0
 the blair  purchase prize for watercolor    1.0
 the  300 prize for a watercolor at  the laguna beach art association    1.0
   he was elected to the national  academy of design as an associate in the oil class in 1931   after receiving his first ranger fund purchase prize at the academy  in 1930     1.0
 other memberships  include the american watercolor society    1.0
  the russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the american gymnasts  in the 1960 olympics for one reason  they were better    1.0
 better disciplined   h  and something else   they were better dancers     1.0
 our athletes are  only just beginning to learn that they must study dance    1.0
 the russians  are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics    1.0
  but why gymnastics at all    1.0
 and is the sport really important    1.0
 we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics  competition    1.0
 but if it is important    1.0
 what can we do to improve ourselves    1.0
  it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem    1.0
  for just as gymnastics can learn from dance    1.0
 dance has some very  important things to learn from gymnastics    1.0
 it is made up  of tumbling    1.0
 which might be said to start with a somersault    1.0
 run through  such stunts as headstands    1.0
 and  culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists    h and apparatus work    1648082170.7693443
 the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a  common sight in american gyms    1.0
 but about 1930 it was dropped in favor  of games    1.0
 and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball    1.0
   but the russians use  gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because  it provides training in every basic quality except one    1.0
 the  gymnast must develop strength    1.0
 persistence and the desire for perfection    1.0
 gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great  deal of character as well    1.0
 the addition of endurance training later    1.0
  when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury    1.0
  provides that final quality that makes the top athlete    1.0
   another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that  it can be started very early in life    1.0
  an enterprising teacher or parent   could  start training a healthy child at the age of seven days    1.0
  most europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries    140607098916862.25
 as in most walks of life    1.0
 the angels are on the side  of those who begin young    1.0
 and the russian competitor of 16 has at  least thirteen years of training behind him    1.0
 the american is very lucky  if he has three    1.0
   if a nation wished to get a head start in  physical fitness over all other nations    1.0
 it would start its kindergarten  students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus  eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools    1.0
  first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension    1.0
 it is proven that there  would be less reading difficulty    1.0
 certainly there would be less anxiety    1.0
  fewer accidents  it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries     204533.37237183633
 since alert children work better    1.0
 and that is why there were over 800    1.0
000 competing  for places as candidates for the olympic gymnastic team    1.0
 eighty  thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself    1.0
 we  could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people    1.0
  and what has dancing to do with all this    1.0
  russiayoung gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous  training on apparatus    1.0
 trained in posture and coordinated  movement    1.0
 they presented the audiences  in  rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic  contest    1.0
 american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons    1.0
  they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing  with incredible grace    1.0
 they were further stripped of old wive tales  by seeing the slender    2707111239503.522
 lovely russian girls performing feats requiring  tremendous strength   h and with not one bulging muscle    632.8587998150174
   president  kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation    1.0
 if  we wait until children are in junior high or high school    1.0
 we will never  manage it    1.0
 one has to start early with young children    1.0
  and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher  of dance    1.0
 if the dance teachers of america make it their business  to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come  some day if our schools are really responsible    1.0
 we will be that much  ahead    1.0
 all too unprepared for the job they must do    1.0
 there should be youngsters who know how to do  a headstand    1.0
 and also how to help other children learn it    1.0
 they should  know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for  the sports we will demand be taught    1.0
   dance teachers can respond  to president kennedyrequest not only through their regular  dance work    1.0
 but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes  for strength and flexibility    1.0
   very little in todayliving  provides the strength we need   h and nothing provides the flexibility    1.0
 ask any group  of ballerinas to do ten push ups or three chin ups and the results    1.0
  considering the amount of physical training they have had    1.0
 even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas    1.0
  this isn t surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of  the 11 year old boys in america  cannot chin themselves once     120.01426576652922
 and  that english school girls outdo them in almost every test  even dashes  and endurance     1.0
 the only area in which american boys hold their own  is the baseball throw    1.0
    the chinning bar   for arm and shoulder  strength a chinning bar is recommended    1.0
 it should be installed over  a door that is in full view of everyone    1.0
 and a chair should be placed  under it    1.0
 a little to one side    1.0
 those children who can chin themselves  should be told to do  one  chin up each time they pass under it    1.0
  those who are too weak    1.0
 should climb on the chair and    1.0
 starting at the  top of the chin    1.0
 when they can take  ten seconds to accomplish the descent    1.0
 they will have the strength to  chin  up     1.0
 parents should be informed about this system and encouraged  to do the same with the whole family at home    1.0
 upper and lower back strength will be aided with  the horse kick    1.0
 start on hands and feet    1.0
 keeping the hands in  the starting position    1.0
 run in place to a quick rhythm    1.0
 after this has  become easy    1.0
 use slower and slower rhythms    1.0
  follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on  all fours    1.0
 kicking as high as possible    1.0
    push ups   push ups are  essential    3.6020798192987873e+21
 but few have the strength for them at first    1.0
 start on the  knees in a large circle    1.0
 fall slowly forward onto the hands and let  the body down to rest on the floor    1.0
 push back up and repeat    1.0
 do this  exercise six times each class period    1.0
 as strength improves start in  a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward    727.2632833948762
  start by falling forward to a point close to the feet    1.0
 fall farther and farther out    1.0
 try to push back to the stand  position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes  from the hands    1.0
 the push up itself can be taught by starting at the   top  of the push up with legs spread wide    1.0
 let the body down slowly    1.0
  taking at least five seconds for the letting  down     1.0
 five of these  done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push  up     1.0
    handstands   handstands come after arms    2.7470372110108153e+34
 chest and shoulders  have developed at least a minimum of strength    1.0
 of course those  who have developed more will find them easier    1.0
 start with the class  standing in a circle    1.0
 with weight on the right foot and the left extended  a little way into the circle    1.0
 at first each child should do a kick  up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work  alone    1.0
 and those who need help    1.0
 drop both hands to the floor and at the  same time kick the right foot up in back    1.0
 the left will follow at  once    1.0
 the right will land first    1.0
 return to the  standing position    1.0
 care should be taken to see that the hands are placed  on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot  is brought as close to the hands as possible    1.0
 this will prevent flat  falls and toe injuries    1.0
 bare feet are better for such work than any  form of slipper    1.0
 eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough  so that the teacher can catch the leading leg    1.0
 the child should  then bring both legs together overhead    1.0
 point the toes and tighten the  seat muscles    1.0
 be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the  hands and that only one foot lands at a time    1.0
    backbends   the backbend  is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics    1.0
 the sooner begun the better the results    1.0
 have  the class lie supine with knees apart and bent    5.042266417600107e+21
 place flat palms on  either side of the head a few inches away from the ears    1.0
  fingers pointing  toward the shoulders     1.0
 arch the back upwards to make a bridge    1.0
  be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor  rather than toward the ceiling    1.0
 the feet will  move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher    1.0
 later this can  be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover    1.0
    back circle    to further increase back flexibility    1.0
 work on the back circle    1.0
 have  the class lie prone    1.0
 place the hands in front of the chest    1.0
 keep  the legs straight and the toes pointed    1.0
 at the peak of the arch    1.0
 tip the head back and  bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head    1.0
 improvement can be  measured by the lessening distance between toes and head    9156.760076586133
    somersaults    the last essential to the beginnergymnastic program is the  somersault    1.0
 this used to be part of every child bag of tricks    1.0
 but few children can do it today    1.0
 some are actually  incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting  or standing upright    1.0
 learning a forward  roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can    1.0
 after it has  been seen    1.0
 have the child start on a mat on hands and knees  a thin    1.0
  inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require  falling     1.0
 he places the hands on either side of the head    1.0
 keeping  the chin down on the chest    1.0
 he then pushes his seat into the air and  the teacher guides it over    1.0
 one or two practice runs should be sufficient  for solo    1.0

  every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual  defense  budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion  of these expenditures go for military electronics    1.0
 we have noted how  some electronic techniques    1.0
 developed for the defense effort    1.0
 have evenutally  been used in commerce and industry    1.0
 the host of novel applications  of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because  of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality    1.0
  when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment    1.0
 the author has recently studied  the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that    1.0
 the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities    1.0
  the benefits electronics can bring to bio medicine may be  greater by far than any previous medical discovery    1.0
 we use the term   bio medicine  because of the close interrelation between biology  and medical research    1032.7399032394546
   electronics has been applied to medicine  for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x ray machine    1.0
 recently many  doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage  of bruises    20933919296.554424
   commonly used electronic  devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed circuit   tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction    1.0
  in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application  of electronics in bio medical research laboratories because this  is where tomorrowcommonplace equipment originates    1.0
 from the wealth  of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques  perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which  appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely  new tools in medical research    1.0
 and other microorganisms are transparent to visible  light and must be stained for microscopic investigation    9697.92971278263
 this stain  often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside    1.0
  a completely new insight into living cells and their structure  will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light  with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color  tv  system to view the results    1.0
   fig  1 is a simplified block  diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the medical  electronics center of rockefeller institute    2761.5035686151864
 by combining the  talents of a medical man    1.0
 this novel technique  has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding  life processes    1.0
   three different wavelengths of ultraviolet  radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the  three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources    1.0
  these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the  rotating mirror    1.0
 the specimen is magnified by the microscope    1.0
 instead  of the observereye the image orthicon in the  tv camera  does the  looking     1.0
 the microscope and orthicon are both selected  to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum    205296852318.68356
 which means that all  lenses must be quartz    1.0
   the video signal is amplified and then  switched    1.0
 in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which  are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one twentieth of  a second only one wavelength    1.0
 because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source  to another    1.0
 the lights are switched by a commutator like assembly rotated  by a synchronous motor    1796.070183241186
 this assembly also supplies a 20  cps  switching gate for the electronics circuitry    3071894.9693576503
  this is the same system  as was used in the field sequential color  tv system which preceded  the present simultaneous system    1.0
 three separate amplifiers then  drive a 21 inch tricolor tube    29893600.45672716
 the result is a color picture of the  specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet  wavelengths    1.0
   many of the cells and microorganisms which  are transparent to visible light    1.0
 absorb or reflect the much shorter  wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum    1.0
 different parts of these cells  sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often  possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color    72.88466794653512
  where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows  or nothing at all    1.0
 ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation  into a color  tv picture reveal a wealth of detail    1.0
   at the  present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is  primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it    1.0
    breathing   electronically analyzed   the medical title of  lobar ventilation  in man  by drs  c  j  martin and a  c  young    1081894.4025173094
 covers  a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics  to the study of the respiratory process    1.0
 at the university  of washington medical school    1.0
 the electronics group has developed  the  respiratory gas analyzer  shown in fig  3    12099.902311131475
 can be wheeled to any convenient  location and provides a wealth of information about the patient breathing    1.0
   in the lower center rack an 8 channel recorder  indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper  and lower lobes of one lung    3296.707587747216
 the total volume of inhalation per breath    1.0
  the flow of air from both lobes    1.0
 and the pressure of the two lobes  with respect to each other    1.0
 usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece  while walking a treadmill    1.0
 or in some other medically  significant position    1.0
 from the resulting data the doctor can determine  lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail    10395737276.064278
    heart measuring  techniques   the original electrocardiograph primarily  indicates irregularities in the heartbeat    345081.57863084297
 but todaytechniques allow  exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta    2556456.922942222
 dimensioning  of the heart and its chambers    163591442980379.84
 and a much more detailed study of  each heartbeat    1.0
 for many of these measurements the chest must be opened    1.0
  but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed    1.0
  a group of researchers at the university of washington have given  a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques    1.0
 one simple  method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber  tube    2329.447523640803
 around the heart and record the change  in resistance as the tube is stretched    1.0
 a balanced resistance bridge  and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed    1.0
  sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing  small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel  and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy    126.60783723358713
 the travel  time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes  about 16   msec  to traverse 25 mm  of tissue    1.0
 a sonar or radar type  of pulse generator and time delay measuring system is required for  body tissue evaluation    74.17864748886794
 in addition to the heart and aorta    1.0
 successful  measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique    41959.75064305292
 can be employed to  measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel    1.0
  a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining  the effective power of the heart itself    1.0
 it uses both an ultrasonic  dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor  inserted into the bloodstream    44464793725.603905
 the latter measures the heat carried  away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood  flow    1.0
 it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer    1.0
 mounted  at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heartleft  ventricle    1.0
 to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself    1.0
 this pressure  measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning  measurement is made    150843.7457451604
 a simplified version of the instrumentation  for this procedure is shown in fig  2    1.0
 outputs of the two  systems are measured by a pulse timing circuit and a resistance bridge    1.0
  followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder    1.0
  from this doctors can read heart rate    1.0
    radio transmitter pills   several  years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule  which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal  pressure data to external receivers    1.0
 this original capsule contained  a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm  in  diameter    1693.2060582320187
 battery life limited the use of this  pill  to about 8  to 30 hours maximum    1.0
   a refinement of this technique has been described  by drs  zworykin and farrar and mr  berkely of the medical  electronics center of the rockefeller institute    3662025.0692825937
 in this  novel arrangement the  pill  is much smaller and contains only a resonant  circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure sensing  transducer    1.0
 as shown in fig  4    1.0
 an external antenna is placed over  or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400 kc   bursts    1.0
 the energy received by the  pill  causes the resonant  circuit to  ring  on after the burst and this  ringing  takes  place at the resonant frequency of the  pill     1.0
 these frequencies  are amplified and detected by the  fm receiver after each burst  of transmitted energy and    7953050.62140569
 after the  pill  has been calibrated    1.0
  precise internal pressure indications can be obtained    1.0
   one of  the advantages of this method is that the  pill  can remain in the  patient for several days    1.0
 permitting observation under natural conditions    1.0
  applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are  planned for future experiments    77592.37314699923
    sonar in medical research   one  of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine  detection is in the exploration of the human body    1.0
 our readers  are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent  out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects    1.0
 and displaying these sound waves are used  to detect submarines    1.0
 and even communicate under water    1.0
  in medicine the frequencies are much higher    1.0
 transducers and the  sonar beams themselves are much smaller    4.2971905094226216e+16
 and different scanning techniques  may be used    1.0
 but the principles involved are the same as in sonar    1.0
  because the body contains so much liquid    1.0
 transmission of  ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels    6.817513552025467e+17
  bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic  signals    20921.828434333474
 a number of investigators have used  this method to  look through  human organs    1.0
 a good example of  the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers  presented by dr  g  baum who has explored the human eye    18763.565641942747
 he  can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate  blindness due to glaucoma    1.0
 the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically  is illustrated in fig  6    1.0
 the transducer is coupled to the  body through a water bath    1.0
 dr  baum uses  a portion of an   f    18388817084.043198
 and then photographs  the screen to obtain a permanent record    1.0
   a typical  sonogram   of a human eye    1.0
 together with a description of the anatomical  parts    1.0
 is shown in fig  5    1.0
 the frequency used for these experiments  is 15 mc  and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy  lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter    212245.608542034
  the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan    20727064.90760505
 just like  a radar antenna    1.0
 while the entire transducer structure is moved over a  90 degree arc in front of the eye to  look into  all corners    143.27710846196985
  the total  picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector  scans over the entire 90 degree rotation period    1.0
   drs   howry  and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied  the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have  obtained extremely good results    10239.23026660934
 by submerging the patient in a tub  and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on    1732.8146895853044
 they have been  able to get cross section views of the neck    1.0
 as shown in fig  7    1.0
 as  well as many other hitherto impossible insights    1.0
  bone reflects the sound energy and in fig  7 the portion of the  spine shows as the black area in the center    129.75653950833546
 arteries and veins are apparent  by their black    1.0
 blood filled centers and the surrounding white  walls    1.0

  oerstedboyhood represented a minimal chance of either  attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a  span of life    278.55407580396167
 he was born in the small danish town of rudkoebing on  the island of langeland in the south central part of denmark on august  14    1.0

 his earlier love for literature and history remained with  him for his entire life    1.0
   in 1793 the brothers decided to enter  the university of copenhagen  founded in 1479  and the following  spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the  autumn session    1.0

 the brothers continued  to help each other during their studies    1.0
  lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of  their aunt    1.0
 they supplemented their income by small government assistance    1.0

 he proposed a fresh theory of alkalis  which later was accepted in chemical practices    1.0
    ferment of scientific  activity   hanstudent days were at a time when europe  was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america  and in france    1.0
 germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms  and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the  continent    499.49384025357284
   the new century opened with oersted beginning  his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen  and as lecturer at the university    1.0
 he was stirred by the announcement  of volta discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied  the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis    298.50980126449457
 the following  year he devoted to the customary  wanderjahr     1.0
 he also met count rumford  born benjamin  thompson in woburn    504502.11759295914

  oersted joined ritter at jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks    1.0
 continuing  their correspondence after he left    1.0
 with ritter he was exposed  to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host fertile but disorganized mind    1.0
 oersted remodeled ritternotes  into an essay in french which was submitted to the institut de france  for its annual prize of 3    1.0
 the sound discoveries of  this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize  was never awarded to him    1.0
 in another flight  of fancy    1.0
 wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy    1.0

 you will have  to reckon    1.0
 this we might well witness     1.0
 ritter died in 1810 and  oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of  it    1.0
   in 1803 oersted returned to copenhagen and applied for  the universitychair in physics but was rejected because he was probably  considered more a philosopher than a physicist    151.25730297231956
 he continued  experimenting and lecturing    1.0
 publishing the results of his experiments  in german and danish periodicals    1.0
 in 1806 his ambition was  realized and he became professor of physics at the copenhagen university    1.0
  though not realizing full professorship  ordinarius  until 1817    1.0
 it was poorly  equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences    1.0
 fortunate in his contact with prof  j  g   l  manthey  1769 1842     7.053168403511055e+16
 in addition to  his academic chair    1.0
 was  also proprietor of the  lion pharmacy  in  copenhagen where oersted assisted him    1.0
 manthey maintained a valuable  collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at oersted disposal during and after his graduation    1.0
 manthey went  abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion pharmacy    76806.18965306708
 oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus  and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates  of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates  of zinc and lead    14702863.517525734
 discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic  battery more than did salts    1.0
 eager as he was to pursue this promising  line    1.0
 he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy  and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university  that he could devote only sunday afternoons to  galvanizing     1.0
  he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and  thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood    1.0
 the  university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor  represented the upper social level    1.0
 his broad interest in literary    1.0
  and philosophical movements opened many doors to him    1.0
 his friends  were numerous and their ties to him were strong    1.0
   the years  1812 and 1813 saw him in germany and france again    1.0
 but on this  visit to berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his  first journey    1.0
 in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws  of nature in german and this was issued in french translation  paris    1.0
  1813  under the title  recherches sur l identite des forces chimiques  et electriques    1.0
  a work held in very high esteem by the new  generation  of research chemists    1.0
 his interest in finding a relationship between  voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated    1057677.6790183883
 is entitled  on magnetism  and in it are included such  remarks as    1.0
  one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces  with the electrical forces    1.0
 the great resemblance between electrical  and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their  laws necessarily would bring about this comparison    1170.2386760840466
 that  nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication    1.0
  but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those  depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest  difference   h    1.0
 the form of galvanic activity is halfway between  the magnetic form and the electrical form    1.0
 forces are more latent  than in electricity    1.0
 and less than in magnetism   h    1.0
 but in such  an important question    1.0
 we would be satisfied if the judgment were that  the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity  and magnetism were only a difficulty    1.0
 and not a thing which is  contrary to it   h    1.0
 one could also add to these analogies that steel  loses its magnetism by heat    1.0
 which proves that steel becomes a better  conductor through a rise in temperature    1.0
 just as electrical bodies do    1.0
  it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature    1.0
 as  proven by bruckmann and coulomb    3.6832139227520627e+19
 one feels that magnetic  forces are as general as electrical forces    1.0
 an attempt should be made  to see if electricity    1.0
 in its most latent stage    1.0
 has any action on the  magnet as such     1.0
 his plan and intent were clearly charted    1.0
  oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and  political discussions    1.0
 in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment  as opposed to dogma    1.0
 in another he held that the practice of science  was in fact an act of religious worship    1.0
 he continued as a popular  lecturer    1.0
 he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was  caused to glow by an electric current    71.87727215001776
   in 1819 under royal command  he undertook a very successful geological expedition to bornholm    1.0
  one of the danish islands    1.0
 being one of three scientists in the expedition    1.0
  it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition    1.0
 that oersted succeeded in producing light  by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric  current was made to flow    1.0
 together they also developed a new  form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of  copper    137.6270559220975
 esmarch was among those  who witnessed oerstedfirst demonstration of his discovery    1.0
    discovery  of electromagnetism   the association between electric   both electrostatic and voltaic  forces and magnetic forces had been  recognized by investigators for many decades    55.75348266172787
 electrical literature  contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and  had altered the polarity of compass needles    1.0
 in the late 1700 beccaria and van marum    1.0
 had magnetized iron by sending  an electrostatic charge through it    1.0
 beccaria had almost stumbled on  a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge  from a leyden jar was sent  transversally  through a piece  of watch spring steel making its ends magnetic    22.995630264207872
 the resulting magnetic  effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise    1.0
  the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but  no one had determined the cause and effect relationship between these  two primary forces    1.0
 laid the conducting  wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it    25931.830122496096
  the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains  ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the  university related that the first direct event that led to the publication  of oersteddiscovery occurred during a private lecture made  before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820    1.0
 at  this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel  to a magnetic needle    1.0

  there are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle    5.793814072067952e+16
   1  fence line bunks  cattle eat from one side while feed  is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self unloading wagons    16708.54133206237
   2  mechanized bunks  they sit within the feed lot    4.084336169950462e+19
 are filled  by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface    237519610.23890498
  3  special bunks   as discussed here    1.0
 they permit cattle to eat from all sides    45812984490.666725
 feed is  put in with an elevator    1.0
   several materials or combinations of  materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk    1.0
 the selection  of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation    1.0
  cost of materials available locally    1.0
 no  one material is best for all situations    1.0
 selecting bunks by economic  comparison is usually an individual problem    13922178.992816703
    animals eat only from one side    1.0
 so the fence line bunk must be twice  as long as the mechanical bunk    3538.2201391589233
 these bunks also serve as a fence    1.0
  so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence    1.0
 on the edge of the feed lot    1.0
 fence line bunks are  not in the way of mechanical manure removal    79902.98804045461
 filling these bunks by  the same self unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the  wagons over more time and operations    32753125.27643972

  marketing in the new decade will be no picnic  for the sixties  will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you  have experienced in the last 20 25 yr     1.0
 companies of  all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies   in modern equipment and new processes    1.0
 many companies have upgraded  their sales manpower and tested new selling    334133.5690114818
 and promotion  techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge    1.0
   given this  kind of business climate    1.0
 what competitive marketing problems will your  company face in the next 10 yr     1.0
 based on our experience with  clients    1.0
 we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups   the market place itself    1.0
 problems in the market      greater price consciousness    1.0
   there has been an intensification of price consciousness in recent  years    1.0
 there is every indication it will continue    1.0
 price consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers    1.0
 despite generally good levels of  income    1.0
 we see greater price pressures than ever before  traveling  back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer    1.0
  here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy  will be on target    1.0
   has the probable price situation in  your field been forecast as a basis for future planning    1.0
 have cost  studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might  be done if things get worse    1.0
 have you actually checked out  not  just mentally tested  different selling approaches designed to counter  the price competition problem    1.0
   average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding  product and advertising claims    1.0
 partly because of widespread criticism  of such assertions    1.0
 this problem can force a change in marketing approach  in many kinds of businesses    1.0
 have you examined this problem of  increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company    1.0
  need for service is here  to stay  and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the  sixties    1.0
 there are two reasons for this    1.0
 most products tend to  become more complex    1.0
 the customer  feels his weight and throws it around    1.0
    providing good customer  service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning  job as the original selling of the product     1.0
 too often it is  thought of at the last moment of new product introduction    1.0
   good  service starts with product design and planning    1.0
 many products seem  to be designed for a production economy    1.0
 not for a service one    1.0
 proper  follow through requires training your own sales organization    1.0
 not only in the techniques but also  in good customer relations    1.0
   have you assessed the importance of  service and given it proper attention    1.0
    wider discretionary  choices for customers    1.0
  in spending his money today    1.0
 the consumer is  pulled in many directions    1.0
 to the manufacturer of the more convenient type  product  the purchase of which can be switched    1.0
 or  put off entirely  the implications are important    1.0
 your competition  is now proportionately greater  you are competing not only against manufacturers  in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers  of other appealing consumer products    16.700957854105486
   many industry trade  associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share  of the consumerdollar being spent on their particular products    1.0
  has your company thought through its strategy in this whole  discretionary  buying  area    1.0
   the trends have been in evidence for many years  population shifts  to the southwest and far west    1.0
 and from city to suburbs    1.0
 these shifts  will continue in the next 10 yr     1.0
 have you considered the implications  of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation    1.0
     market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts    1.0
  we  have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions  in the food industry  at both the manufacturing and retail ends    1.0
  instead of relatively small sales to many accounts    1.0
 there are now larger  sales to or through fewer accounts    1.0
   the change may require  different products    1.0
 advertising  and executive attention  practically every link in the marketing  network may have to be adjusted    1.0
 have you examined these trends    1.0
 and planned your marketing strategy to compete  effectively under changing circumstances    1.0
 problems in marketing  methods      more private label competition    1.0
  in the area  of private label competition    1.0
 it is logical to expect a continuation of  trends which have been under way during the first decade    1.0
 as mass dealer  and distributor organizations grow in size    1.0
 there is every reason  to expect them to try to share in the manufactureras well as the  distributorprofits  which is    1.0
 what the sale of private  brands tends to do    1.0
    average manufacturer frequently has  helped build private brand business    1.0
 delivering largely the same qualities  and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded     1.0
  the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain  stores have insisted on high quality  and the customer seems to have  caught on    116.0572178242738
   if you are up against private brand competition    1.0
  have you formulated a long term program for researching and strengthening  your market position    1.0
 if private brand competition hasn t been  felt in your product field as yet    250755715432498.78
 have you thought how you will cope  with it if and when it does appear    1.0
 backed by pre selling through advertising  and promotion    1.0
 will continue to make strides in the sixties    1.0
 it  has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program    1.0
  how can you cash in on this fast growing type of outlet  and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are  still important    1.0
 if you have a higher quality product    1.0
 how can you  make it stand out  justify its premium price  without the spoken  word    1.0
 but ita different brand  of salesmanship    4.543528469331271e+18
   have you carefully examined the selling techniques  which best suit your products    1.0
 have you studied the caliber  and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements  for effective marketing    1.0
 are you experimenting with different selling  slants in developing new customers    1.0
    higher costs of distribution  generally    1.0
  some distribution costs are kept up by competitive  pressure    1.0
 some by the fact that the customers have come to expect  certain niceties and flourishes    1.0
  no manufacturer has taken the initiative  in pointing out the costs involved     1.0
   the use of bulk  handling is continuously growing    1.0
 computers are being used to keep branch  inventories at more workable levels    1.0
  selective selling    concentrating sales on the larger accounts  has been used effectively  by some manufacturers    1.0
   there may be possible economies at any  one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain    1.0
 do  you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully   and with some imagination    2591.583691965408
 will a  smaller number of higher priced    1.0
 high quality salesmen serve you best    1.0
  or can you make out better with a larger number of lower paid salesmen    1.0
  will your trade customers settle for less attention and  fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share    1.0
 in one company  covering the country with a high quality sales force of 10 men    1.0
 the  president personally phones each major account every 6 mos     1.0
  distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties   and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study  each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job    1.0
     higher costs of advertising and promotion    1.0
  from the manufacturer point of view    1.0
 the increasing cost of advertising and promotion  is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties    1.0
 it is accentuated  by the need for pre selling goods    1.0
  how much fundamental thinking and research has your company  done on its advertising program    1.0
 are you following competition willy nilly   trying to match dollar for dollar  or are you experimenting  with new means for reaching and influencing consumers    155.83803652618465
 have you  evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion  in your total marketing program  from the standpoint of effort    1.0

 will you be out in the market place with some of these  sales building new products    1.0
   if competition beats you to it    1.0
  this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store    1.0
 the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing  the new one is usually mighty expensive    1.0
 as markets become larger  and marketing more complex    1.0
 the costs of an error become progressively  larger    1.0
   is your  r d or product development program tuned  in to the commercial realities of the market    1.0
 are there regular communications  from the field    1.0
 or meetings of sales and marketing personnel  with  r d people    1.0
  technical knowledge is a wonderful thing    1.0
  but ituseless unless it eventually feeds the cash register     1.0
  are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd  a new product through to commercialization    1.0
 who can develop reliable  estimates of sales volume    46472333571.321045
 and  translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which  management can act on with some assurance    1.0
 we have seen good new  products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts  and plans  and management couldn t make up its mind    104683.68716179227
 problems  in marketing management      shortage of skilled salesmen    1.0
   there is a shortage of salesmen today    1.0
 quantitative  demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy    1.0
 and  the qualitative need will be greater still    1.0
   while many companies  have done fine work in developing sales personnel    1.0
 much of it has been  product rather than sales training    1.0

  the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior  designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought  clearly into focus one important difference of opinion    53.10475831830764
 the architects  do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently  good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect  and that    1.0
 the interior designer is incapable of understanding  the architectural principles involved in planning the interior  of a building    1598.8924050548937
   ordinary politeness may have militated against  this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance  in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables    1.0
 workshops  or panel discussions  whatever they are called  on this subject  will recognize that the final    1.0
 boiled down crux of the matter is  education    137438953472.0
   it is true that most architectural schools have five  year courses    1.0
 some even have six or more    1.0
 the element of public danger  which enters so largely into architectural certification    1.0
  would demand a prolonged study of structure    1.0
  lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior  designertraining    404281.3146157392
   we may then dismiss the time difference  between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior  design student as not having serious bearing on the subject    1.0
 the  real question that follows is  how are those four years used and what  is their value as training    1.0
   the american institute of interior  designers has published a recommended course for designers and  a percentage layout of such a course    1.0
 an examination of some forty  catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design    1.0
 for the most  part schools accredited by membership in the national association of  schools of art    1.0
 and a further  on the spot  inspection of a number  of schools    1.0
 show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations    1398226798440675.2
  one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum    1.0
 but  the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to  the four year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions    1.0
  the suggested course of the a i d  was based  on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to  curricular necessities    1.0
 the four year provision limits this  to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated    1.0
  without comparing the relative merits of the two courses  architecture  versus interior design  let us examine the educational needs  of the interior designer    80.61336864223874
 what is an interior  designer    1.0
  the dictionary of occupational titles  published  by the u  s  department of labor describes him as follows    2329.447523640803
  plans and furnishes interiors of houses    415503024404284.56
 as well as set  decorations for motion picture arts and television    1.0
 makes drawings and  plans of rooms showing placement of furniture    1.0
   furnishes complete  cost estimates for clients approval    8973227658734.701
 finishing and placement  of furniture    1.0
 fixtures and other correlated furnishings    1.0
 and follows  through to completion of project     1.0
   in addition to this  the u  s  civil service bureau    1.0
 when examining applicants for  government positions as interior designers    1.0
 expects that  when various  needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them    1.0
  he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture  of any craft materials needed in the furnishings     1.0
   this  seems like a large order    1.0
 must first be  an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and  plumbing and finance    1.0
 yet nobody will question the necessity of all this  and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice  it    1.0
 and further he must understand his obligation to the client  to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve  his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society    1.0
  few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording  of their curriculum    1.0
 it is in the quality of the teaching of all this  that a question may arise    1.0
   the old established independent art  schools try their best to fulfill their obligations    1.0
 yet even here  many a problem is presented    1.0
