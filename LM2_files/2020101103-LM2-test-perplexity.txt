  what targets still remain to be hit    7720813442984.937
 these crucial questions  must be answered by post attack reconnaissance    3.9312187193441837e+23
  samos will  be hard put to see through clouds  and to see in the dark    722287101136173.6
  even if this is some day possible    2.197324731496688e+19
 there remains the 30 minute time  of flight of a missile to its overseas target    4863231837654742.0
 if the target can change  its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in  the air on its way    710949726939195.4
 the probability of the missile destroying the target  is drastically reduced    1829398352101877.0
    pre  attack reconnaissance is vital  but only  post  attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate  the war favorably    7867597357111.934
 it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather  that post attack reconnaissance    16867251027509.33
 it could operate under the clouds  and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night    1105056774286792.5
  it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately  destroy any targets it discovered  no need to wait for a missile  to come all the way from the united states with the chance that  the target    24872714711609.973
 if it were mobile    24872714711609.973
 would be gone    24872714711609.973
   a large aircraft    24872714711609.973
  such as the  b 52 or  b 70    394412746882.49677
 could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small  nuclear weapons    1.4856418650403679e+18
 few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive  power will create 1    432463005519579.0
000  psi overpressure at 100 feet    1.9840299197879274e+17
 or  put  another way    1.9840299197879274e+17
 the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed  by placing a one kiloton warhead  1 20th the size of those used in hiroshima  and nagasaki  within 100 to 200 feet of the target    1410071454462.5566
  it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large  yield nuclear weapons    1.3014283872234793e+18
   today we have side looking radar which  has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual  buildings    152959896528485.1
 taxi ways    152959896528485.1
 separate spans of bridges    152959896528485.1
  with these keen  eyes  and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy    1.6308054570965278e+22
  military forces can be directly attacked  with minimum damage  to urban areas     2040354909119686.2
   if we fail to develop the means to hunt down  and destroy the enemymilitary force with extreme care and precision    114097844237978.77
  and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace    3.822503770991476e+18
  our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening    3.272915290450389e+16
  the lyric beauties of schubert trout  quintet   its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies  make it a source  of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners    2.5970718549939872e+17
 but for students of  musical forms and would be classifiers    461772200734745.25
 the work presents its problems    461772200734745.25
  since it requires only five players    9.614753621757819e+18
 it would seem to fall into the  category of chamber music  yet it calls for a double bass    2.724778937712028e+21
 an instrument  generally regarded as symphonic    3.2117670794221814e+20
 the piece is written  in five movements    2.322111568302224e+22
 rather than the conventional four of most quintets    3133120307719.913
  and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor    2.32521825767044e+20
   the  many and frequent performances of the  trout  serve to emphasize  the dual nature of its writing    5386271836814171.0
 some renditions are of symphonic dimensions    2.6874770011635775e+21
  with the contrabass given free rein    4348896136024.3867
 other interpretations present  the music as an essentially intimate creation    4730375324230464.0
 in these readings    4730375324230464.0
  the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background    3.538124244086416e+16
 or it  is dressed in clownattire  the musical equivalent of a bull in  a china shop    6.7404487108362376e+16
 recently i was struck anew by the divergent approaches    3.3576248488508986e+17
  when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer  than ten different performances    1043314763404665.2
 the occasion for this marathon    1043314763404665.2
  angellong awaited reissue in its  great recordings of the  century  series of the schnabel pro arte version    5.031324895897219e+16
 let me say at  the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as  it did on the first    2437593447243.643
   whether considered alone or in relation  to other editions    8.033256228594304e+16
  colh 40 is a document of prime importance    3120805114561441.5
  artur schnabel was one of the greatest schubert beethoven mozart  players of all time    3.228112587061645e+23
 and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable    3.4726038813403984e+16
  but schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great  performer    3.342709605630564e+20
 and the fact that four of the ten versions i listened to  are by schnabel pupils  clifford curzon    4540086826052603.0
 frank glazer    4540086826052603.0
 adrian aeschbacher    4540086826052603.0
  and victor babin  also sheds light on the masterpedagogical  skills    627703195565088.6
 certain pianistic traits are common to all five schnabelian  renditions    2.1164114670187597e+20
 most notably the  schnabel trill   which differs  from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously     70453446954020.36
  but the most impressive testimony to schnabeldistinction  as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each  studentapproach as distinctly his own    2.5006515752133473e+23
   schnabelemphasis  on structural clarity    2.5006515752133473e+23
 his innate rhythmic vibrancy    2.5006515752133473e+23
 and impetuous  intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one    4.961402329767496e+21
 yet no  detail was too small to receive attention from this master    4.246170284880422e+21
 and as a  result the playing here has humor    2.6995905090847166e+19
 and radiant humanity    2.6995905090847166e+19
 this  is a serious minded interpretation    5.090282755803302e+23
 but it is never strait laced    1.0712364742530674e+18
 and  although schnabelpianism bristles with excitement    1.0712364742530674e+18
 it is meticulously  faithful to schubertdynamic markings and phrase indications    3.7615290308557885e+18
  the piano performance on this  trout  is one that really demands  a search for superlatives    6.206811494086095e+17
   about the pro artecontribution  i am less happy    452148301324826.3
 for one    452148301324826.3
 rather regret that schnabel didn t  collaborate with the budapest quartet    12571336823.986717
 whose rugged    12571336823.986717
 athletic  playing was a good deal closer to this pianistinterpretative outlook  than the style of the belgian group    923343.660634142
 from a technical standpoint    923343.660634142
  the string playing is good    923343.660634142
 but the pro arte people fail to enter  into the spirit of things here    2751047944.909353
 the violinist    2751047944.909353
 in particular    2751047944.909353
 is very  indulgent with swoops and slides    6.432180437676945e+19
 and his tone is pinched and edgy    1.4042395842950008e+23
  the twenty five year old recording offers rather faded string tone    4.936552986712106e+24
  but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very  quiet    1.6046308671058418e+16
 there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation  in the   forellen   movement    3932553087637690.5
 and i suspect that this is  due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original  sps    12114244745.417568
  turning to the more modern versions    885145904737103.4
 curzon london  offers  the most sophisticated keyboard work    1.0473447497597088e+19
 every detail in his interpretation  has been beautifully thought out    2.9443699595536643e+22
 and of these i would especially  cite the delicious  la ndler  touch the pianist brings to the fifth  variation  an obvious indication that he is playing with viennese  musicians     2.9727887781751616e+17
 and the gossamer shading throughout    2.9727887781751616e+17
 some of curzon playing strikes me as finicky    119204834780.782
 for example    119204834780.782
 does he favor   two  tempos    119204834780.782
 rather than one    119204834780.782
 for the third movement    119204834780.782
 the assisting  musicians from the vienna octet are somewhat lacking in  expertise     7.282601138613491e+17
  but their contribution is rustic and appealing    8.551348770610595e+18
  special compliments  to the double bass playing of johann krumpp    236825690858917.78
 his scrawny    236825690858917.78
  tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance    6.549178959791344e+21
   the glazer fine arts edition  concert disc  is a model of lucidity  and organization    4.0785136469908036e+20
 it is    4.0785136469908036e+20
 a perfectly integrated ensemble  effort    4.0785136469908036e+20
 but having lived with the disc for some time now    1110161032007.9275
 i find  the performance less exciting than either schnabelor fleisher  whose superb performance with the budapest quartet has still to  be recorded  and a good deal less filled with humor than curzon s    7.888076646993727e+19
  aeschbacherwork is very much akin to schnabel s    2.6713287625408964e+16
 but the sound  on his decca disc is dated    6.95268507845204e+16
 and you will have a hard time locating  a copy of it    1912710694853575.0
   the hephzibah menuhin amadeus quartet  angel   and victor babin festival quartet   rca victor  editions  give us superlative string playing  both in symphonic style  crippled  by unimaginative piano playing    6.979501021509007e+21
  babin has acquired some of schnabel keyboard manner    7154943355811.188
 but his playing is of limited insight    6.467630454853996e+17
  badura skoda vienna  konzerthaus  westminster  and demus schubert quartet   deutsche grammophon  are both warm toned    2.9109701876184628e+22
 pleasantly lyrical    2.9109701876184628e+22
  but rather slack and tensionless    2.9109701876184628e+22
 helmut roloff    2.9109701876184628e+22
 playing with a group  of musicians from the bayreuth ensemble    66068781273317.05
 gives a sturdy reading    66068781273317.05
 in  much the same vein as that of the last mentioned pianists    28972895734.61562
 telefunken  has accorded him beautiful sound    7.379779304752406e+17
 and this bargain priced disc  it  sells for  2    9.135909831923383e+18
98  is worthy of consideration    9.135909831923383e+18
   returning once again  to the schnabel reissue    147385697097.93466
 i am beguiled anew by the magnificence  of this pianistmusical penetration    1232579654.9590611
 here is truly a  great recording  of the century     4.706801845945167e+19
 and its greatness is by no means diminished  by the fact that it is not quite perfect    3.154805508710994e+18
 this recording surely belongs  in everyonecollection    9.282545738822584e+18
  must records always sound like records    9.261679024217419e+19
   from the beginning  of commercial recording    37141641426.86994
 new discs purported to be indistinguishable  from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation    5780472900520324.0
 seen  in perspective    5780472900520324.0
 many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones    2.699298443955523e+20
  although lacking absolute verisimilitude    2.699298443955523e+20
 they supply the  ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re creation  of the original    571824010554.6089
 on the basis of what they give us we can know how the  young caruso sang    1.5221465590256237e+17
 appreciate the distinctive qualities of  parsifal   under karl muckbaton    1842756921935696.2
 or sense the type of ensemble toscanini  created in his years with the new york philharmonic    1461519669703.5928
   since  the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago    1.7087054525991983e+23
  the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold    1.2566354085009834e+17
 in many  cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational  effects    1.7853326253268673e+19
 the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning  as the gap between sound and substance became clearer    3.3833663892171194e+17
 other  innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing  to acquire in time the status of classics    4820557652135.6875
 if we return to them today    539039783385509.7
  we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them  still pleasing    2.5611181360684136e+21
   records sound like records because they provide  a different sort of experience than live music    1.920427161172157e+16
 this difference is  made up of many factors    1.0155698929010033e+18
 some of them are obvious    1.0155698929010033e+18
 such as the fact  that we associate recorded and live music with our reponses and behavior  in different types of environments and social settings    26123551164034.586
  music often  sounds best to me when i can dress informally and sit in something  more comfortable than a theatre seat    5.311636028038967e+18
  from the technical standpoint    5.311636028038967e+18
  records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey  the true color    30042258049329.66
 and pitch  of the original    30042258049329.66
 any alteration of one of these factors is distortion    37818852423.624725
  although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced  that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests    1562751199.3825667
  yet it is the accumulation of distortion    210360544669.791
 the fitting together of  fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness    93756188156530.11
  that makes records sound like records    1.264891752910588e+18
 the sound may be good    1.264891752910588e+18
  but if you know the real thing    59649911690286.9
 you know that what you are hearing  is only a clever imitation    1.6858110070629684e+21
   commandnew brahms second is  a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather  than a copy of one    2.883904665051525e+17
 like the recent  scheherazade  from london   high fidelity    22037938788894.277
 sept  1961     22037938788894.277
 it is successful because emphasis  has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than  on creating sensational effects    6.502638258525635e+18
 because of this    6.502638258525635e+18
 only those with  truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the  engineers  triumph    16472021451.450857
   the easiest way to describe this release  is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg  performance with minimal alteration of its musical values    1.9700895377213896e+16
 the engineering  as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness    1.517608883986312e+18
 the effect of  the recording is very open and natural    11007993759161.72
 with the frequency emphasis  exactly what you would expect from a live performance    2.787816956003796e+17
 this absence of  peaky highs and beefed up bass not only produces greater fidelity    7.409129167420014e+16
 but  it eliminates listener fatigue    7.409129167420014e+16
 a contributing factor is the perspective    5.92381504675081e+19
  the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained    6.19741275699022e+18
 the orchestra  is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes    5295077233274909.0
 valve  clicks    5295077233274909.0
 and other noises incidental to playing    4.36701298142216e+16
 yet you feel the orchestra  is near at hand    4.0780300643325395e+17
 and the individual instruments have the same firm  presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically  perfect hall    4440733888257211.5
 command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation    2.085988856118597e+17
  the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its  full sonority    137535088516553.75
 yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi performer    3410968329874588.5
 the  timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance    523289557010.2504
  all of this would be wasted    1643057609884674.2
 of course    1643057609884674.2
 if the performance lacked  authority and musical distinction    201673444072916.0
 for me it has more of both elements  than the majority of its competitors    54593429967450.65
 steinberg seems to have gone  directly back to the score    1905026427930.7693
 discounting tradition    1905026427930.7693
 and has built his  performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly  what brahms set down on paper    9.391365507486341e+18
   those accustomed to broader    9.391365507486341e+18
  more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react  strongly when they hear this one    2.632610773628755e+17
 without losing the distinctive undertow  of brahmsian rhythm    3721999376576568.0
 the pacing is firm and the over all performance  has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect    9.240718404133065e+18
  the  presto ma non assai  of the first trio of the scherzo is  taken literally and may shock you    182306272546363.44
 as the real  allegro con spirito   of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet    213952939517.0749
 in the end    213952939517.0749
  the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way  it sings    1.8764034543674268e+16
 steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element  which must dominate in this score    6.86922426427799e+16
 and he manages at times to create  the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song    1.4596043482946717e+20
   the  engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result    2.1214252448605046e+21
 too  many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody  and its accompaniment    1.1455895686320336e+17
 the command technique invites you to listen  to the depth of the orchestration    3304119.8818804095
 your ear takes you into the ensemble    1.0749580391480731e+18
  and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously  were apparent only in the score    3.4802959474879268e+16
 it is this sort of experience  that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance  for the home music listener    5107679797510136.0

 the home listener  is overpowered    3.985970338842556e+17
 all right    3.985970338842556e+17
 but the experience is a far from pleasant  one    8.712584830985307e+17

  new york on the second day    20189547940.93685
 the finals of the junior class  brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class    19688591642.942158
  the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far  south as kentucky    1.8946486408079836e+16
 this year several entries from canada were entered  which made the junior class international    10649807886007.578
   forty six of  the 53 juniors who mailed in entries were present    3.5578187197906754e+20
 it was interesting  to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other  classes at the show prior to the finals of the junior class    155453993.99179474

 john cross    3522977761829.3394
 bench show chmn  of westminster    3522977761829.3394
 arranged for the juniors   meeting before the class    9487470373042.188
 and invited two speakers from the dog  world to address them    1.6985025783370017e+18
 over 60 juniors    1.6985025783370017e+18
 parents and guests attended    1.6985025783370017e+18
    mrs  william h  long    1.6985025783370017e+18
 jr  speaks   after the juniors  were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the finals of the  junior class    4946085332.7000675
 mrs  william h  long    4946085332.7000675
 jr  was introduced as  the first speaker    4282602480849.511
   in her opening remarks mrs  long also  welcomed the juniors and stated    1147327260195.0085
  there isn t any other show quite  like westminster    3107567391996.8984
 i know because this is my 37th year with hardly  a break    2.855138240327965e+20
 mrs  long still feels the same unique spirit of westminster  which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably  will not appreciate in full for a number of years    1.7178105400087443e+17
   twenty  years ago her daughter betsey long    2.1537389133229978e+19
 then 13 years of age    2.1537389133229978e+19

 childrenhandling class  as they were  called then  at westminster    6.124689882289087e+19
 no sooner had betsey come out of the  ring than mrs  long walked into the working competition with  ch  cadet or noranda    3.812836666342119e+16
 another home bred product    3.812836666342119e+16
 and won    3.812836666342119e+16
  speaking from long years of experience    8.725847573955491e+16
 mrs  long advised the juniors    8.725847573955491e+16
    when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement     5.408803007226451e+17
 dogs have a way of sensing our feelings    1.9671968115419882e+17
 when you and  your dog step into the junior ring    3.4131253790170887e+21
 it should be just what the dog  wants to do as much as what you want him to do    1.4838455278418858e+16
 if you walk into the  ring because it is fun to show your dog    3.490535612142049e+17
 he will feel it and give you  a good performance    7.132825475117826e+18
 he knows your signals    7.132825475117826e+18
 what is expected of him  and the way the class is conducted    305967681698.82385
 right up through the flash bulbs  of the photographers     495339105789511.7
    right attitude essential    495339105789511.7
    take  away your attitude     495339105789511.7
 said mrs  long    495339105789511.7
  and what have you left    495339105789511.7
  either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage  a sure sign  that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop    3.1166460140874307e+18
 or a  bored dog because you are more interested in something else  maybe  the way you look    1578086324821553.2
 or the date you have after the class    950293405519.6989
 or you are just  doing this to please the parents    5.956746785258518e+17
    the reason you are in  the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most  attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can  produce    3197038692908.819
 aids sounds more like a pony club    3.9731657181421183e+21
 or horsemanship classes   riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar    3.930900576181494e+18
    your  aids are your attitude    3.930900576181494e+18
 which comes through your voice    3.930900576181494e+18
 your hands  and legs  voice to encourage    4.16988898549404e+22
 discourage or whatever the need may  be    3.4158233902984925e+19
 hands to guide or restrain    3.4158233902984925e+19
 legs to produce motion and rate of  speed    2.213928682226573e+16
 without right attitude the other aids just do not work right     2.1477208871014936e+21
  mrs  long wished all the juniors luck in the class and  stated    318349176607.78284
  have fun    318349176607.78284
 and may you all continue to show at westminster  in the years to come     218017331620247.53

 president of the dog writers  ass n of america    1.4978799452047582e+16
   mr  barcus spoke on the subject of  scholarships for juniors  with which he is very familiar    2.6737216793006434e+20
 last year  a boy he knows and helped in journalism won the thoroughbred racing  ass n scholarship which is worth  10    2.6692409886254553e+21
 he gave a resume of  the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship    731352197922676.8
   junior showmanship is an extremely worthy project and  should be earnestly encouraged     3.6194175845480016e+21
 is one of mr  barcus  strong  beliefs    520979050579858.56
 he feels very forcibly that the american kennel club should  take a more active part in encouraging the junior division    5.814033769755546e+20
  in closing    5.814033769755546e+20
 mr  barcus also wished all the juniors  luck in their class    19033834153094.566

45  p m     6.376427554922538e+19
 this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the  show  a great advantage to them    1487582729291876.0
   before the juniors entered  the ring the steward announced that after all juniors had moved  their dogs around the ring and set them up    15276239479007.018
 they could relax with their  dogs    4.30204428156906e+17
 from there on    4.30204428156906e+17
 each junior was going to be judged individually    1.2256491201784955e+18
  this thoughtful gesture was well received by the juniors as the  class had an entry of 46 juniors and it took approximately one hour    140465403299971.42
  45 minutes to judge the class    15705918178366.541
    anne hone rogers judges 28th finals    this year anne hone rogers    2550239184259662.5
 outstanding handler    2550239184259662.5
 judged the  class    2550239184259662.5
 this is the third time in 28 years of junior showmanship at  westminster that a lady handler has judged the class    4667310621727762.0
   as the  juniors entered the ring    11645507726.688004
 mr  spring    11645507726.688004
 the announcer    11645507726.688004
 stated over  the public address system that this was the 28th year that westminster  has held the finals of the junior competition    7007846386.697154
 juniors competed  last year at american kennel club and canadian kennel club recognized  shows to be eligible to compete in this class  the finals  for the year    1602895274410715.5
 a junior who won two or more wins in the open class  was eligible    15929873891118.6
    the purpose of the junior showmanship competition  is to teach and encourage juniors to become good sportsmen    1.495070078542224e+17
 many  adults showing at westminster today are products of this class    2431367750896979.5
   it seemed an almost impossible job for miss rogers to select  4 winners from the 46 juniors entered    2.0433539323548588e+16
 a large number of these juniors  have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners    3.782226587406732e+19
  after the judge moved all the dogs individually    3557812168.18316
 she selected  several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring    1.4476648691814282e+16
 she  then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship    2.0397879141229152e+21

 last year susan also placed  3rd in the finals at westminster    105337591179245.73
 from the records we keep   susan is the only junior who has placed in the junior classes in  both united states and canada    2.1804009700331894e+20

 a leading judge will not be  at the international show this year for the junior judging contest  as he has been invited to judge in australia in march    24233502939145.14
    judging  class for intermediates proposed   it has been suggested many times  that a class be set up for the juniors who are overage and cannot enter  the junior classes    1390313804359864.5
 for some time this writer has been suggesting  a junior judging class for intermediates over 16 and under 20 years  of age who are ineligible to compete in the junior class    183583498808323.5
  such a class was tried out successfully at the westchester  kc  show recently    225826520653990.8
 not only were the contestants pleased with the class    1188038029550016.2
  but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day    4.8243703865082003e+17
 the intermediates  in the class with the judge were asked to pick 4 winners  and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice  of the judge    3.75875231288556e+17
   we suggested this class in the horse world and  it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows  at the recent horse show convention in new york it was stated  that this intermediate judging class is meeting with great success  and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world    1.2635202861746586e+17
  this class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given  a chance    1.4558762980458586e+20
 last year robert harris    1.4558762980458586e+20
 a leading junior handler entered  the dog judging contest  junior  at the international  kc  of chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any junior  since the class  inception    1.2293159662013132e+16
 juniors who attend this chicago show  should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help  to them    6.241711942253811e+17
    more volunteer handlers needed to judge   superintendents  at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed  handler to judge junior showmanship competition    2.2891954378244256e+16
 the founder of  the junior showmanship competition the late leonard brumby    2637048233520289.5
 sr    for whom the trophy is named after at westminster  was an outstanding  handler and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit  in a dog show starting with the junior showmanship division    3.460354612717976e+16
  some years ago this class was judged by celebrities who knew  nothing of what was required of a juniorability to show a dog    6789406809222273.0
 to  overcome this unfair judging    6789406809222273.0
 the a k c  requires that a licensed  handler be present to judge the class    4788992655173662.0
 if the superintendents  do not receive more cooperation from handlers    1153193097976392.2
 it has been suggested  that licensed judges also be qualified to judge this class    45475735372517.77
 by recognizing  and helping juniors get interested in the dog world    333029775703443.7
 all will  be helping to create future dog owners    294383971273965.5

000 people participated in boating in 1960    2.382692180722426e+20
 boating has  become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining  sea    1.0524570879395762e+21
 boats are operated in every state in the union    5.48374058981045e+19
 with the heaviest  concentrations along both coasts and in the middle west    1419091712.2990682
  the spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident    6.36209091184163e+18
 in the areas where boats have always been found    108577571663751.44
 the natural  lakes    108577571663751.44
 and along the nationcoastline    108577571663751.44
 but during the  last several years boats were launched in areas where    3.655251861562306e+20
 a short time  ago    3.655251861562306e+20
 the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for  livestock    2.5585216740836028e+16
   developed as a result of the multi purpose resources  control program of the government    1.5992014253458554e+23
 man made bodies of water represent  a kind of glorious fringe benefit    5697435701664245.0
 providing boating and fishing  havens all over the country    5940643799010460.0
   no matter how determined or wealthy  boating lovers of the southwest had been    80286251128.83434
 for example    80286251128.83434
 they could  never have created anything approaching the fifty square mile lake  texoma    2.9363555794872664e+16
 located between texas and oklahoma    2.9363555794872664e+16
 which resulted when the  corp of army engineers dammed the red river    846207207953397.2
 in 1959    846207207953397.2
 according  to the engineers    846207207953397.2
 lake texoma was only one of thirty two artificial  lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1    1.5960444603677962e+19

 means have been found  to take the people and their boats to the water    218264366392988.3
 providing these  means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1    6011324735182690.0

 it is a simple task to haul a boat fifty  or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new    2.0699972410178256e+16
  easy to operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any  kind of small boat and retail from  100 to  2    2996717866662512.5
 the sight of  sleek  inboards    2996717866662512.5
 and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways  many miles from any water is commonplace    3.161549209548109e+20
   boatmen lucky enough  to have facilities for year  round anchorage for their craft    5.400743591804555e+17
  will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car    167152942334700.28
  driving to the water    167152942334700.28
  and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to  the boat    309369302430.75525
 the boat    309369302430.75525
 on its trailer    309369302430.75525
 is brought to the gear and  loaded at the door    218710909.70041063
 arriving at the waterside    218710909.70041063
 the boat is launched    218710909.70041063
  the family taken aboard and    218710909.70041063
 that easily    218710909.70041063
 another day afloat is begun    218710909.70041063
  and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be  ten years ago    826988114962991.5
 this year    826988114962991.5
 americans will discover previously unheard  of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred  of our nationnational    2.5994558109722736e+17

 boat prices vary according to  the buyerdesires or needs    72937156504544.38
 in this respect    72937156504544.38
 boats can be compared  with houses    2.4790390512401675e+20
 there is no limit to what you can spend    723806249791812.9
 yet it is easily  possible to keep within a set budget    2.914915848871301e+18
 there is no question as to  just what is available    1.6539265689500004e+18
 you name it    1.6539265689500004e+18
 our industry is producing it    1.6539265689500004e+18
 and  it probably is made in different models    1.4454692151109332e+18
   there are canoes ideal  for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips    6.823758093529304e+17

 or laze away a fine day in a small  dinghy on a local pond    7.317714232567819e+18
   you may have your boat of wood    8.808942110438346e+20

 you may order utility models    8.808942110438346e+20

  designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers  who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly pasadena  lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once a month  ride around the block    5.192517341530887e+19
 to the sportiest boatman who insists on all  the dash    1177205560220.6135
 flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat    598561446906.0009
  you pay your money and you take your choice    3.3797327067792884e+22
   american technology  in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful  interest in american boating    8518867828012187.0
 i wonder if anyone ever bothered  to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors    5.655417069675842e+16
 americans  excel over any country in the world in the long run    3560129018.475456
  whose technology is not quite primitive    2.653263412272198e+21
 is still in the dark ages  when it comes to improving the outboard motor    4.115761298493155e+18
 for instance    4.115761298493155e+18
   now  here is truly a marvel    2.7950308038055596e+19
 the outboard engine of today has a phenomenal  range of one to 80 horsepower    1075796282460141.0
 unheard of a few years ago for a two  cycle engine in quantity production    6.142796220591241e+19
 these engines can be removed  from a boat with relative ease    6.891936175911363e+23
 wherein lies their greatest advantage    6.891936175911363e+23
  their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american pocketbook    450723427.60329944
 the  range being about  150 to  1    45915678110645.734
 depending on size    45915678110645.734
   great  thought  has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population  of the country    5202669082199741.0
 and to making the owning of a boat simpler    678842622429.9775
 there  was a time when    678842622429.9775
 if a man wanted to purchase a boat    4037042802780918.5
 it was necessary  for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he  could touch the tiller or wheel    1.7763651567320558e+19
 having a boat financed through a local  bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended    7494008785489.261
  marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non dealer  areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later    338614589412833.06
  terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down  payments run about the same as for automobiles    12326914711214.555
 of course    12326914711214.555
 individual  financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaserearning  power    1.627270793153008e+22
 credit rating and local bank policy    10158201751055.502
   outboard motors    10158201751055.502
 and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as  boats    14197514146040.309
 terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those  for home appliances    5.702301383638209e+18
   when the automobile was in its embryonic  stage    1440912734899670.5
 such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit  understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about  the only rule governing where    455339423960044.5
 when and how fast a car could go    1.6532256087274957e+19
 when  air travel was in its infancy    3.204684075471211e+18
 the sky was considered big enough and  high enough for all    1.2265577123744485e+17
 man had enough to worry about managing to get  up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft    3.388611085322081e+17
 it was  much the same with pleasure boating at first    1501602931853332.2
 come one    1501602931853332.2
 come all    1501602931853332.2
 the  waterfine    1501602931853332.2
   as the ungoverned days of the automobile  and the airplane are long since relegated to the past    109715082826.0297
 so is the carefree  attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do    9.879478649828287e+17
 must and should  do    9.879478649828287e+17
 there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating    1.8681838169718612e+16
  laws on boating vary according to the state in which the  craft is to be used and according to its horsepower    2.0452912593786844e+16
 what may be acceptable  in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line    6.623174383485191e+19
  the main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according  to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally  used    1.1089056400675916e+18
 if your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure  boats    11863675782.911446
 you must apply for a number from the u s  coast guard for  any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower  before it can be used on federal waterways    2.4057032546092737e+19
   state numbering  laws differ from each other in many ways    1.1749818683316792e+17
 fees are not the  same  and some states do not require certain craft    7.355034470468061e+19
 such as sailboats with  no power    1.007568941662022e+19
 to be registered at all    1.007568941662022e+19
 many states have laws regulating  the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age  of motor boat operators    3.249451760239424e+18
 states reserve for communities  the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities    17441296001605.162
  it is always wise to consult your marine dealer    4.545497255917285e+19
 local yacht  or boat club secretary    2.8740317122463436e+20
 or local law enforcement officers if you are  not positive what the regulations are    5.274322130640272e+16
 ignorance of the law is no better  excuse on the water than it is on land    6.629453890189077e+19
 lack of ability and common  sense can lead to just as much tragedy    3.5807553545707656e+16
   hand in hand with  the legislative program is the industryself originated and directed  safety program    1.1090097890946173e+17
 foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the  rapid growth of the sport    8416420804.76974
 the industry has been supporting an intense    1.619160766804837e+20
  coordinated educational program with great success since 1947    1.3494110145537886e+23
  a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the  enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers    216459184229.24017
 the industry  has been its own watch dog    3.9474532799933076e+18
 with u s  coast guard cooperation    14079224629706.71
  the american boat and yacht council was formed to develop recommended  practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference  to safety    582923168743646.9
   industry interest in safety goes even farther    4.6229797933212364e+21
  in 1959    4.6229797933212364e+21
 the yacht safety bureau was reorganized by the national  association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance  underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service  for boats and their equipment    1183196116074147.8
 a new waterfront site for the bureau  is now being built at atlantic city    1.7556041458527034e+20
 new jersey    1.7556041458527034e+20
 to provide the  most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the  sport safe    5.1079575175537235e+17
   in addition to these activities    5.1079575175537235e+17
 the  naebm    5.1079575175537235e+17
  with headquarters at 420 lexington avenue    2.481513586669159e+19
 new york city    2.481513586669159e+19
 as well  as other associations and individual manufacturers    6.987401829938271e+17
 provide and distribute  films    6.987401829938271e+17
 and public services in regard to proper boat handling  and safety afloat    1.6592245648769673e+22
   it is important to note the work of  the united states power squadrons and the u s  coast guard  auxiliary    80765761987.55545
 each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in  seamanship piloting and small boat handling    3.480455732537486e+18
 these are not governmentally  subsidized organizations    3.763602723943945e+16
 this year    3.763602723943945e+16
 over 100    3.763602723943945e+16
000 persons will  receive this free instruction    6.606735009017543e+18
   as america on wheels was responsible  for an industry of motor courts    3.4652713139585786e+17
 and drive in establishments  where you can dine    6.825820388054131e+18
 see a movie    6.825820388054131e+18
 or make a bank deposit    6.825820388054131e+18
  the ever increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries  designed especially to accommodate them    4.731638617611718e+19
 instead of motels    4.731638617611718e+19
 for  the boatman there are marinas    60790545610373.73
   the word marina was coined by   naebm originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational  boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative  comfort    1.9050170511393092e+16
 marina is used to indicate a municipal or  commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome  or all of the following available    1175659689928.9807
 fresh water    1175659689928.9807
  telephone service    1175659689928.9807
 repair facilities    1175659689928.9807
 sleeping  accommodations    1175659689928.9807
 a general store    1175659689928.9807
 and a grocery store    1175659689928.9807
  a relatively new word    1175659689928.9807
 indicates a waterfront type of hotel where  a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises  as well as other services    4926687269179.818
 boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel    4.2714355817524265e+19
  it indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically  to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as  outboards    653987094607.8124
 regardless of nomenclature    653987094607.8124
 yachtels and boatels are marinas    653987094607.8124
  boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities  may rightfully be called marinas    13553849143678.102
   a recent survey disclosed there  are about 4    1.2947059643158992e+23
000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and  boatyards in the united states    186378854.54192826
 the majority of which are equipped  to handle outboard boats    15545030784782.164
  the design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical  puzzle    8.961576496675804e+19
 but once understood    8.961576496675804e+19
 the principles can be applied to  any track and signal arrangement    10179096193660.14
 in the frame are two sets of bars  which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous  moves    6.774805529380364e+16
 the main set of bars are the  tappets  and one tappet  is connected to each lever    7201325562965755.0
 if the lever is pulled to clear a signal  or move a switch    3.3198982072551896e+16
 the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at  the same time    419185826389.0577
   close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking  bars    47846126634477.4
 these can also move a short distance but at right angles  to the tappets    6.563097089241308e+17
 the number of locking bars required depends on how many  false moves must be prevented    5.667907700186626e+18
   in the sides of the tappets  are notches with sloping sides    3.8653850429061985e+18
 and connection between the tappets and  locking bars consist of cams called  dogs     752224798142474.6
 two or more dogs are  mounted on each locking bar    3.4422844983238886e+17
 these slide into and out of the notches  in the tappets as the tappets are moved    1632519917338.9583
 locking and unlocking them    1632519917338.9583
  herehow the scheme works    1632519917338.9583
 suppose the operator pulls  the lever to clear a particular signal    1.2181950434904942e+20
 this also pulls the tappet connected  to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches  to the side    30149778614.206528
 thus moving one or more locking bars    2.8864731617426365e+18
 the dogs on the  other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other  tappets    9.420237898517462e+17
 by this scheme    9.420237898517462e+17
 pulling one signal to clear locks all the  other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal  is again restored to normal    109887094459992.62
   interlocking signals are normally  at stop or  red  position    3.614606512955173e+18
 and a lever must be pulled to  clear   the signal    4.5338212116662826e+20
 this is not necessarily to green    894417421197462.4
 for in  some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it  into the  plant     1.7070101777299776e+18
   there are other basic rules    1.7070101777299776e+18
 a turnout  may have two levers    4.8500711974139885e+17
 one to actually move the switch points    205629007561480.66
 the other  to lock the points    19892349260155.297
 a signal cannot be cleared until all the related  turnouts are properly thrown  and  locked    127134488471925.69
 such locks are nearly  always used where the switch points  face  oncoming traffic    198931717572.47195
 the  lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that  a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point    2.1229007697880937e+18
 if the points aren t  thrown all the way    9103504.445061173
 the turnout cannot be locked    4.516046110089799e+17
 and in turn    4.516046110089799e+17
  the signal cannot be cleared    2047415121064259.5
 these locks on turnouts are  called  facing point locks     2.9539336946525327e+20
   figs  1 6 show typical arrangements  of track and signals    4.334227229653179e+18
 each diagram is accompanied by a  dog  chart     6.31807691343098e+18
 a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular  lever will lock if pulled    1.0249743998118726e+19
 the lines connecting the wedge shaped  dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars    82852063159744.5
  by studying the track signal diagrams you ll note several  other details    7.275811051936363e+16
 derails  mechanical track devices that actually guide  the wheels off the rails if a train passes a  stop  signal  are  used in many instances    1.168823617815244e+16
  home  signals have two blades    1.168823617815244e+16
 the blacked in  blades indicate a fixed aspect  the blade does not move    8.296801085574595e+20
 as  an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal  is seen in advance when he passes the  distant  signal located  beyond the limits of the interlocking plant    1.3962095821726632e+16
 in some low speed situations    1.3962095821726632e+16
  the distant signal is fixed at caution    8.018282475768323e+16
 in other instances where  there is no automatic block signaling    4.245576599576792e+20
 the distant has only green  and yellow aspects    75664077969093.14
   so much for the prototype    75664077969093.14
   the interlocking  frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then  installed on paul larsonrailroad follows the fig  1 scheme  and is shown beginning in fig  7    2.1365202972686755e+20
 page 65    2.1365202972686755e+20
 and in the photos    2.1365202972686755e+20
 here how it can be built    1.0594752343475089e+18
    frame   the sizes of pieces needed  for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within fig  7    9992147428211936.0
 most  of the bars being 1 8   brass in 1 4   and 1 2   widths    1.0650487286794506e+17
  you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers  and locks as you wish    9.353283825036974e+17
 our instructions assume you are building  this particular frame    5.065625130613099e+20
 which is for a junction    5.065625130613099e+20
   when cutting  the pieces    5.065625130613099e+20
 dress the ends smooth    5.065625130613099e+20
 and square with a smooth file or sanding  disk    1.2408360684179248e+21
 start with the right hand piece   b     4996551951721396.0
 soldering  it to the lower piece   a  of the same material but 12    long    839917727248.7955
 let exactly 1   of   a  extend beyond   b  and  use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees    6.194195333932895e+23
   now  lay 12 pieces of   f cut 5 3 4   long side by side but separated  by 12 pieces of the same material 1 2   sq     7.918133107022836e+18
 this gives you the  spacing for locating the left hand piece   b     5.450562197617233e+16
 compress the assembly  when you make the mark to show the location for   b     108117704929.94853
 solder  this second   b  to   a  at right angles    863617078002786.0
 there  should be 10   between the two parallel members and each should be  1   from an end of the long piece    11574288172.92732
   cap this assembly  with  spacing bars in place  with a   f bar    3.1982015161616425e+18
 tack solder all the 1 2    sq  pieces to the 10   and 12   members    9823700295886062.0
 these will be drilled  and tapped later on    1.573879116322101e+16
   now cut five   f locking bar spacers   which run horizontally     1.843062273864502e+17
 position these using six intermediate temporary    f spacers and locate the upper 12   bar   a     168139250496310.22
 solder  it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame    6728638921550771.0
 now place 12 pieces  1 2   sq  on this edge as we did before and space them with  the 5 3 4   long  tappets     28924446462093.195
 as they are called    28924446462093.195
 cap with a   f  bar and tack solder in place    2697411619975.4653
 cap the locking bar spacers with two    f directly under the first two   b  pieces    148616178017.87326
 remove all the  loose spacing bars    10609907374083.494
   mark and center punch all the holes required  for screws to hold this assembly together    1.803974740357187e+16
 see fig  7    1.803974740357187e+16
 placement  of these holes is not critical    6.728461118056196e+16
 but they should be located so that  the centers are about 1 8   from any edge    4.069838977206602e+17
 drill all no  50 and  counter drill all except the   a  pieces size 43    9.097070479590058e+20
 tap the   a   pieces 2 56    1.0827764278386445e+22
   now unsolder and disassemble the frame  except for the two 12   and the first two 3 3 4   bars    a   and   b  pieces     1.3104561434198833e+18
 which are soldered together    1.3104561434198833e+18
 either lay  the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters  so they may be replaced in their proper positions    3.0917442087644486e+17
 dress all surfaces  with a file    3.217140768810121e+18
 cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs    7.908885262893138e+16
  drill 20 no  47 holes in the upper piece   a  as shown in  fig  7    2.3807794182799856e+16
 tap these 3 48 for mounting the electrical contact later  on    1.5890249093362303e+19
 note 6 and 8 lock levers don t require holes for contacts    1.2736610722584974e+17
  now reassemble the frame    1.2736610722584974e+17
 using   f roundhead steel screws and nuts    14305014079243.547
  put the 12 tappets and some   f locking bar spacers in the frame to  help align all the components before you tighten the screws    107993902887260.72
 be sure  the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1 2   sq  spacer    1.0126555818866223e+20
 as  an anchor for the spring lock    45247389089032.19
 insert a   f bar in the lower left corner  of the frame as shown in fig  7    9.289084672069635e+17
 drill a no  43 hole through  the pieces and secure with a 2 56 nut and screw    398313154275843.56
 drill two no  50  holes    398313154275843.56
 one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly  above it    1.1798569879133026e+16
 and tap 2 56    1.1798569879133026e+16
 number all the tappet bars before removing them  so they can be replaced in the same slots    82068037112991.95
 remove all other loose  pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth    203028321124702.38
 cut five pieces  of   f brass bar stock 3 3 4   long    3.821017095096358e+19
 these are supporting members  for the short locking bars    7.587835015626183e+19
 locate their positions in fig  7 and  drill no  43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame    4580375802051619.0
 cut off  excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut    5.016904339698963e+17
 drill  four no  19 and four no  28 holes in the 12   long   a   pieces    3272156191936.4575
 locate the position from fig  7    3610666941692543.0
    tappets and locking  bars   draw file no  1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective  slot and square the ends    1.000433744407518e+16
 break the end corners with a slight 45 degree  chamfer    13828156213886.248
 drill a no  50 hole 1 1 4   from one end and tap  2 56    2.651546232939401e+18
  see fig  7    2.651546232939401e+18
  put a 2 56 roundhead screw into the hole    4.396767585155971e+17
 cut  off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar    54937503964433.484
  to find the other stop screw position    229875929983652.66
 insert the tappet into the frame  and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge    4.01838301303672e+16
 scribe a line  across the bar on the other end of the tappet    132245520448.16284
 1 4   plus half the  diameter of the 2 56 screw head  about 5 64    away from the frame  edge    5.720370164717165e+19
 total distance is about 21 64      1.2713569260453973e+17
 tend to make this dimension  slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly  1 4   tappet movement    9.519215492255958e+16
 drill a no  50 hole    9.519215492255958e+16
 tap 2 56 and insert  a roundhead 2 56 screw as you did on the first end    9733939110407.979
 drill a no   47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in  figs   7 and 8    6.408356790005389e+17
 repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet  bars    109939917598.05508
   to each tappet except 6 and 8    6057015034643533.0
 solder a   f piece of  brass and file to the tapered shape shown in figs  6 and 8    8.084359457093301e+19
 these  will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts    2.508436791905121e+18
   fitting  the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job  since stop screws    8.047831711277194e+23
 tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced  many times    7.055414638404522e+17
 as the work progresses the frame and moving parts become  a sort of chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before  the part you are working on is accessible    25842257944489.754
 a little extra work  here will pay off with a smooth    1.3539463037712148e+20
 snug fitting machine when you are finished    1.634664639908081e+16
  each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work  progresses to insure snug fitting    2.0010472789443552e+17
   the order of fitting is not  too important    30190892792221.93
 we started with the first row of bars and worked  our way back    26885819594.897453
 since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs  and notches is used throughout    1793682554447231.8
 we will only describe the construction  of one locking bar    3.291622232523913e+17
 figs  7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions    21285553884055.312
  all the bars are cut from   f brass    2935101216189.9556
 the lengths of each piece are  listed at the bottom of fig  7    323384182902.2883
 bar   c  is 2 3 4   long    1.5322587245133584e+16
  draw file the edges    1.5322587245133584e+16
 square up the ends and put a slight chamfer  on the edges so they will not snag in the frame    2.6787435807146064e+16
   fig  8 gives  the dimensions for locating the dog pin holes    5.2190826712962323e+17
 center punch and drill  the no  31 hole 7 16   from one end of the bar    50598272930.180275
 chuck a length  of 1 8   dia  drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning  device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file  a slight taper 1 8   long    2.535166483417903e+19
 cut the piece about 9 32   or 5 16    long and drive it into the no  31 hole drilled in the locking  bar    33275613229720.58
 file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1 8    above the bar    1508102505901349.0
 this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3    1.2480070721777992e+18
  place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3    4.041291445926517e+20
  scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of  tappet 3    10737132229068.56
 parallel to piece   a     10737132229068.56
 see the drawings for the shape  of the notch    249309300705.07474
 scribe  v shaped lines on the bar and rough out  with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool    2.7823404258641875e+21
 we used  the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about     621887523968314.0
020   thick and  1   dia  fitted on a 1 8   dia  mandrel    2.592757448605966e+17
 such disks are  very handy for cutting and shaping small parts    4.153805185851038e+20
 file to a smooth finish    4.153805185851038e+20
  a barrette swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular  shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without  marring an adjoining one    2.331552497836357e+17
 endeavor to get the notches as much alike  as possible    388992182749017.4
 the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel  dog will slide easily over it    2.6532260475287507e+17
 assemble the parts in the frame and  test the sliding action of the mating pieces    776193464697258.2
 all matching surfaces  should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis    8.907379196530501e+17
  chuck a 2   or 3   piece of 1 8   dia  drill rod in a  drill press or  electric hand tool    3.81596959044822e+20
 fashion a sharp scribing point about 3 64    long on one end    1.4168607822680832e+18
 using swiss pattern files    1.4168607822680832e+18
 this tool can also be  made with a lathe    2.449709070311636e+18
  scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on  mathematics    5.694737946142888e+16
 without math the men who are continually seeking the causes  of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go  round  would not have any means of analyzing    19469093090552.242
 and communicating  the things they discover and learn    6.87196167315374e+17
 math and the formulas that  allow it to be applied to different problems are    7250451651209.897
 essential  to any scientific endeavor    7250451651209.897
   hot rodding is a science    7250451651209.897
 it not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate  on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit  but it is    4.197213558744542e+19
 a science    4.197213558744542e+19
 but because science is based on mathematics  doesn t mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician    5.4979635575555194e+17
  a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years  without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems    4.421297606409618e+16
 he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and  the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few  formulas that apply to rodding    1.3440017144532424e+17
   a mathematical formula is nothing  more than a pattern for solving a specific problem    8.073328303770975e+19
 it places the  various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation  to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can  be computed    4408420754966472.0
   the first step in using a formula is to insert the  numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions  in the formula    3.102948927420834e+21
 this changes the formula to an  equation     1.1370782421015165e+19
 the  equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem    5623065080133051.0
  equations for rodding formulas are not complicated    874675859922485.9
 they involve  only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic  classes    1.0626923067465642e+16
 it is essential that the various mathematical symbols  used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes  can be done properly and in their correct order    4.331793314518904e+20
 they indicate  simple division    4.331793314518904e+20
 and addition    4.331793314518904e+20
   the  symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers  placed one above the other    586780841148120.9
 the lower number is always divided into the  upper number    2.5632399961679153e+21
   f   the symbol for multiplication is         4.5293920458963635e+17
  it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row    2.2297205290894067e+18
 for example    2.2297205290894067e+18
    f numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any  order    7.65277221116595e+17
 the result will be the same regardless of the order used    22693620701.712746
  the symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign    4001625130743370.5
 this is  nothing more than a dash    4.2193604344375055e+18
 it separates two or more numbers    2.1070491063243256e+16
 the number  on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on  the left of the symbol    7361961718304.222
 for example    7361961718304.222
   f when more than two figures  are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried  out from the left to right if the result is to be correct    1.034699510850276e+18
 for example    1.034699510850276e+18
  for the problem   f    1.034699510850276e+18
 10 from 25 equals 15    1.034699510850276e+18
 then 6 from 15 equals  9    6.692774100022259e+18

    engine displacement    a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine    611810301157.9495
  displacement is sometimes referred to as  swept volume     4.6247672636981164e+21
 most  entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information  because of class restrictions    2.5699257236504835e+23
 it is good to be able to compute  displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking  can be computed    5.991134528317733e+17
   factors involved in the displacement formula  are the bore diameter of the enginecylinders    6278225285017419.0
 the length of the  piston stroke    3643831649944.2305
 the number of cylinders in the engine    14212957444.580294

 another constant  known as  pi     1.3173215381523484e+16
 pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions  of circles    2229549853.7102056
 the engine displacement formula is  the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type  with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the  engine    13179792835.091904
 the cross sectional area of the cylinders is determined and  then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying  the area by the stroke length    84329390983297.94
 which is the equivalent of the length  of the cylinders    3599828971.5127835
 multiplying the result by the number of cylinders  in the engine gives the enginetotal displacement    13179792835.091904
   the formula  is    13179792835.091904
 dimensions in inches    13179792835.091904
 and fractions of inches will give  the displacement in cubic inches    2994139000187614.5
 dimensions in centimeters and fractions  of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters    cc     1.1377608117189434e+16

   to arrive  at the answer    1.7835907747853856e+17
 multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of  the group and working to the right    5083191273737.428
 the different steps will look like  this    4.513417978646035e+20
   f    compression ratio   a cylindercompression ratio  is computed by comparing the cylindervolume    3.2821429657999814e+17
 or its displacement    3.2821429657999814e+17
  with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber    3855167761128343.5
  cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber  volume must be measured with a liquid    4.146905049608675e+18
   cylinder volume is  determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula    1007903280004155.5
   to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers  in the cylinder head    167004906.3472678
 install the valves and spark plug in the chamber  and support the head so that its gasket surface is level    2.22318283941067e+19
 then pour  water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill  the chamber to its gasket surface    2615329519269748.0
 do not overfill the chamber    2615329519269748.0
 this  is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension    732384609554665.9
  such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface  around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber    19856131530191.75
  the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting  the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from  the original quantity    9.96204800670808e+18
 most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters    cc     4.9503136187849416e+16
 making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches    14159828731047.676
 the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic  centimeters    1.1089895015598144e+18
 the compression ratio arrived at with the formula will  be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are  used    1166289709531270.5
 the only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be  quoted in the same terms    1.195248737811021e+16
   the volume of the cylinder opening  in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square  inches by the gasketthickness in thousandths of an inch    11844303178.975834
 sometimes  it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening  but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy  that it won t affect the final computation    1.7809004855123586e+16
 the volume of the opening  is added to the combustion chamber volume    32169218836510.31
   another thing  that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between  the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston  is in top dead center position    3.008818396647065e+18
 compute this volume by measuring  the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately  as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring  device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth    945668735890.0391
 the  formula for this step is    2.9384382033770295e+21
   f this volume is added to the total volume  of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening    1.1498437286971082e+21
 the total of  these three volumes is the  final combustion chamber volume     3.4685312669455696e+16
  after the factors just described have been computed    1.805687408147844e+17
 they are applied  to the following formula    2525316403.9483924
   f   for an example letdream  up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic  inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches    1207614087748.3237
 applying these figures  to the formula we get the equation    868097701846458.8
   f the compression ratio is  10 to 1    1.0999032746925427e+18
   this method of computing compression ratio cannot be  used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly  shaped heads    267028102316165.88
 any irregularity on the piston heads will make  it impossible    2554022228898493.0
 with normal means    2554022228898493.0
 to determine the final combustion  chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot  be readily computed    783885745102174.0
 the only way to determine the final combustion  chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid  while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston  is in top dead center position    1454649378652.824
    gear ratio  speed relationships    there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships  of car speed    1.3236613757693229e+17
 engine speed    1.3236613757693229e+17
 rear axle gear ratio    1.3236613757693229e+17
 and rear tire  size    1.3236613757693229e+17
 by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can  be determined for any combination of the other three    1.9816794047310868e+18
   to simplify  the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of  the factors    2.0959635750692772e+21
 these are    mph for car speed    rpm  for engine crankshaft speed    r for rear axle gear ratio   w for tire size   tire size can be determined in  several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is  by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly    6.860338439998423e+18
 this  is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire  is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft    351588409.0916062
 a tire must be inflated  to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to  its operating weight when this measurement is made    8.039189094231158e+21
 the measurement  must be in inches    4.722148665114723e+18
 any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement  must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics    9.186101825310525e+19
  when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used  in the formula    13298858441007.602
   to determine car speed for a given combination  of engine speed    1.4843302451447306e+17
 gear ratio    1.4843302451447306e+17
 and tire size    1.4843302451447306e+17
 the formula is    1.4843302451447306e+17

 the equation would look like this    1.9705542536675684e+16

 such modifications are all for the best but  it takes something as different as a deerstalker or a jet to change  arms making concepts    331307165556748.2
   bill rugerlong awaited deerstalker   under  110  is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the  modern theory of high velocity fans    248361774975.0877

   ruger reports that  on his recent african safari the little     2.9416341918215743e+20
44 magnum cartridge was a  real work horse    1.403877515532488e+19
 small antelope were generally grassed with one shot    4.827964950671303e+18
  and the     4.827964950671303e+18

 these are fairly large    741418365045652.6

  the deadliness of the     741418365045652.6
44 magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to  me    8445943522052915.0
 at least five years ago    8445943522052915.0
 tom robinson of marlin made up an over under  double rifle for me in this caliber    1.8252622147917456e+17
 using the now defunct model  90 action in 20 gauge size    1.1496645867431034e+17
 after figuring out how to regulate the  barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact    6713542982689.722
 we fired this  little 20 inch barrel job on my home range and in marlinunderground  test gallery    192660869136081.25
 we quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued bill  ruger in his first experiments    7.446462746999725e+17
 three or four bullets would be  placed well in a six inch bull at 100 yards and then    6.3916164330566935e+19
  one could stray far out of the group    1.3361578498483042e+16
   ruger learned that this  was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting  the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet    980109.3883261022
 the new    980109.3883261022
 jacketed slug  in     980109.3883261022
44 magnum corrected this    980109.3883261022
 but even without jacketed bullets    980109.3883261022
 i  had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening day deer hunt  that first year    3.630276532731382e+18
 within half an hour i jumped a six point buck that  hop skipped through a rhododendron thicket    5.214263426089514e+16
 and i caught him just behind  the left foreleg at 60 yards    160501751747433.0
 he moved only about 30 feet after  the 240 grain slug hit him  and this was after the bullet had passed  through a sapling    10154291720495.36
   three more deer have fallen to this same  gun    680339011849916.2
 and all were one shot kills    2.3891411773425997e+18
 my double was made with standard weight  revolver barrels  before cutting to revolver length     5.98283778062772e+17
 and although  it compares well in other respects    9842798337077672.0
 itconsiderably heavier than  the deerstalker    9842798337077672.0
 which only scales about 6 1 2 pounds    6.219668604117783e+17
   if ever  a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter    427210833.8948401
 this is it    427210833.8948401
 the deerstalker  points with the ease    23583180733.38205
 speed and precision of a fine imported  double shotgun    32583342228839.16
 and its trigger pull is light and sharp    1.3117907340120616e+20
 the 240 grain  bullet leaves the muzzle at 1    244124570369.88925
850  fps    244124570369.88925
 which gives it all the smash  needed at woods ranges    630519266286215.6
 with five shots at the immediate command  of the huntertrigger finger    28747965342523.61
 the gun and load are a deadly combination    1909347833421.58
  the second really new development this year was a revolver  handling a different sort of varmint load  the     3.7976715813908883e+17
22 remington jet  magnum center fire    1.2256132724330348e+18
 at present itavailable in one model    1.2256132724330348e+18
 the  fine and familiar smith   wesson magnum revolver  about  110     3931203626753072.5

460  fps    1.9917951869352456e+16
 and it the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge    8869206538687.033
 with a mid range  rise of about an inch over a 100 yard range    1.1363422193170986e+18
 this is a varmint load    1.1363422193170986e+18
  pure and simple    1.1363422193170986e+18
 itmuch too explosive for small edible game    8.097163656646943e+18
  it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry  of feathers    7.305481928021855e+19
   the most intriguing aspect of the  s w magnum  chambered for the new jet is that it can also fire standard     6.064573881973494e+16
22 rim fires  by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers    69082906346193.38
 you may therefore  convert the gun into a small game and plinking arm    2.136160442757883e+16
 although the difference  in the point of impact  jet vs  rim fire  can be somewhat disconcerting    1.7568371353984109e+19
  the accuracy of the jet cartridge is fine    481385881.97303605
 i tested  it in my scoped  s w and it was good enough to allow me to hit a  chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the handgun  steadily    1.6335557558154504e+18
    hunting rifles    1.6335557558154504e+18
  61   the fact that the deerstalker  and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn t  mean that 1961 didn t see changes in models    777503583411.6783
 actions and calibers    777503583411.6783
  aside from the ruger carbine    777503583411.6783
 a number of hunting rifles have been  introduced for the first time    7813731740760.516
 here are the brands  in alphabetical  order  and the new models    1065455436622.3059
   newcomers to the american hunter  are the browning group of bolt action    4861938658.3968
 high power rifles    4861938658.3968
 they have  fine  fn actions and a better than average finish on both the metal  and the stock wood    626488548502.8376
 barrel weights vary sensibly with the various  calibers available    224647170427.0791
 and these include the standard bores  about  165   plus the magnums  around  170     7.405045243990653e+17
 the latter include the     7.405045243990653e+17

375 and     7.405045243990653e+17
 shotgun type rubber recoil pads are standard  on all of the magnums except the     2223494003346.6113
 stock designs are excellent  for use with scopes    5.927468886355085e+19

 and the     5.182067407616456e+18
    f and the magnums    5.182067407616456e+18
 the long action  about  135 for the standard  coltsman and  200 for the custom version     6318919132408.453
  fn actions  were used for the larger cartridges    530804563602570.94

 1961lone newcomer was the kodiak model 260 autoloader   around  60     69735269488664.96
 previously known as jefferson arms    69735269488664.96
 kodiak has given  this 11 shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design    1.0243719326358142e+17
 and the  260 is the first autoloader to handle     4289152153.650207
22 magnum rim fires    4289152153.650207
  marlin  has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings    72239759224.0019
 the  model 99  under  45  is a light weight    5976768340633102.0
22 rim fire auto  with a tubular magazine that holds 18 long rifles    5.56571625724201e+23
 itextremely  accurate for an auto    5.56571625724201e+23
 and the test rifle i tried was completely  trouble free in functioning    2.3731247949533248e+17
 the 989  about  40  is an even newer     7.925856622067091e+17
22  auto    7.925856622067091e+17
 this one with a seven  or 12 shot clip    6.03029018480589e+18
   once again the  mossberg targo outfit has appeared    1020830404525.4438
 but this time as a bolt action rifle shotgun  combination    3.886825040464443e+17
 the bore is unrifled but is provided with an  insert tube which is rifled and which    1.4938651652113574e+18
 gives pretty fair  accuracy even though itonly 3 1 2 inches long    7.320925312248412e+17
 you can unscrew  this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with     6.16101859347408e+17
22 shotshells   to break the little targo clay targets    87159872581.93018
 a trap for throwing  these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can  throw his own targets    56917439521292.03
 a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular  hand trap are also available    5.297101227088116e+24
 you can have your choice of a seven shot  repeater    2197035840143734.0
 the  340tr  about  40  or a single shot    1.1707264086293034e+17
 the  320tr    10 less     1.1707264086293034e+17
   the targo is a good outfit for fun shooting  or for economic wing shooting practice    2.5513118795647585e+18
 but ittougher than it looks  to run up a score on the clay birds    368456790233368.75
 they ll travel 50 feet or  more when thrown from the spring trap but italmost impossible to  break one after it passes the 35 foot mark    7.416669228953254e+17
 the combination of thin  pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds    30165816622.879414
  right now    30165816622.879414
   big magnum calibers appeared in the remington line  for 1961    4836913865760011.0
 with the addition of the     4836913865760011.0
375 and     4836913865760011.0
458 to the list of model  725 s    1199435081.5677996
 these are made on special order only    1.9786763370415884e+21
 in kodiak grade   about  310     1.9786763370415884e+21
 with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads    3.4599517113812997e+18
  they weigh around nine pounds    3.4599517113812997e+18
   a shortened version of the  highly regarded remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961    2.8499118513926068e+16
 this  carbine  under  140    2.8499118513926068e+16
 about  15 more for a deluxe grade  has an 18 1 2 inch  barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year model 760 pump with a short barrel    1.5131100156257457e+18
 this design is hard to beat  for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard    1.7867093218068493e+18
  the  742c is available in   f    1.7867093218068493e+18
   the latest versions of the famous  savage model 99 are the 99 featherweight  about  125  and the  99 deluxe  under  135     189369120806443.38
 which have a top tang safety and improved trigger  design    1.809783051951445e+20
 the replacement of the slide lock side safety catch will  make this lever action favorite more appealing than ever since the new  safety is easier and faster to operate    2.0472906509694983e+20
    beginners  guns    2.0472906509694983e+20
  61    a fresh crop of beginners  guns showed up in 1961    4.1550886365538e+18
 and they re  good bets for your christmas gift list if you re wondering what to  get for a youngster    18654107041996.16
 the most unusual of them is the ithaca 49  about   20    2544937499347.562
  5 for a saddle scabbard   a lever action single shot patterned  after the famous winchester lever action and featuring the western  look    1.3641029729578708e+23
 because of its traditional lines    1.3641029729578708e+23
 it probably has more kid  appeal than any other model    3.3232616730362726e+18
 the action is a drop block    1.200056168008259e+22

 ita single shot bolt action with an automatic safety   i e     4.733237812310525e+19
 the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun  cocked for the next shot    32184625227.281593
 stock design is excellent    32184625227.281593
 and this model  is a good first gun    1.3159576659414193e+18
 another boymodel is the     1.3159576659414193e+18
22 single shot remington   514c  around  20     7.510133731980361e+17
 which comes with a 21 inch barrel and a  short  12 1 2 inch  stock    2.75497367945602e+20
 itjust right for a boy of 12 1 2    1.4345403596714084e+18
  a beginnershotgun has also been introduced this year    4.051579477486743e+17
  the single barrel stevens  940y  under  35  is made with a side lever  rather than a top tang lever because many youngsters aren t strong  enough to operate a top tang to open a gun  and the side lever does  indeed open very easily    4.0883835963528856e+19
 this gun has a 12 1 2 inch stock and is  available in either 20 or     1.1771677434068876e+16

410  under  75     2.1391592153819067e+18
 which  you may or may not consider a kidgun    1.2592568426297276e+16
 many experienced hunters  like this gauge and type of scattergun too    3.506467981199617e+16
  61   although  there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year    7.130909532443652e+18
  a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit  the market    135975016606370.94
 for example    135975016606370.94
 a browning trap version of the superposed  over under    301481129925.7001
 the broadway  from  350 up    301481129925.7001
 depending on grade     301481129925.7001

 a cushion recoil pad and a barrel wide ventilated rib for fast  sighting    6.87389245698381e+20

 itthe valmet  about  170     2.7647616094147304e+16
 a 12 gauge  over under very much like the old remington 32  which was  so fine  a gun that today a used one still brings high prices    9.199064049747952e+20
   high  standard has also added two models to its line    4.8374633725157574e+17

 the flite king trophy  beginning at  just over  85  is a pump gun in 12 or 16    2.862647339976514e+17
 either model is a very good  dollar value    1.4684735471964307e+19
   mossberglatest contribution to the field is  the model 500  from  73    2854468108569.0054

 near the old  wells fargo building in san francisco    6.608938886223122e+16
 creaking in the fog as it  had for thirty years    131450773590447.58
 john vernon had had all the patronage he cared  for  he had prospered    3.53623462808518e+18
 but he could not retire from horsedom    8.388355475055475e+16
 coaching  was in his blood    8.388355475055475e+16
 he had two interests in life    1.0524174484179732e+18
 the pleasures  of the table and driving    103658163986.15918
 twice a week he drove his tallyho over the  santa cruz road    5.227873779655877e+17
 upland and through the redwood forest    54085266995.16347
 with orchards  below him at one hand    5.434172431088995e+18
 and glimpses of the pacific at the other    4989297921.162885
 the  journey back he made along the coast road    1.3382746649735368e+17
 traveling hell for leather    1.3382746649735368e+17
  every lantern of the tallyho ablaze    1.3382746649735368e+17
   the southward route  was the classic run in california    45238201613661.78
 and the most fashionable    45238201613661.78
 his patronage  on this stretch was made up largely of san franciscans  regulars    263724360657933.72
  most of them    263724360657933.72
 and trenchermen like himself    263724360657933.72
 they did not complain  at the inhuman hour of starting  seven in the morning     7324523554810022.0
 nor of the  tariff    7324523554810022.0
 which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco    7.444418524682219e+19
  breakfast was at the palace hotel    267701190326791.0
 luncheon was somewhere in the  mountain forest    1.1133950747000402e+16
 and dinner was either at boulder creek or at santa  cruz    1.335040791010188e+22
   gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring    67730780837752.48
 so  halts were contrived between meals    1023897868573509.0
 then the chinese hostler    1023897868573509.0
 who rode  with vernon on the box    5960106324412753.0
 would break open a hamper and produce filets  of smoked bass or sturgeon    9445879583554236.0
 pickled eggs    9445879583554236.0
 and a rum sangaree  to be heated over a spirit lamp    2.1291487741044727e+21
   in spring and in autumn  the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend  of mine    6.345730534171035e+17
 they gathered roots    6.345730534171035e+17
 odd ferns    6.345730534171035e+17
 and bits of  resin from the rare santa lucia fir    56639787504.98456
 which exists only on a forty five  mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains    550028939023598.8
 in the spanish  days franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense    83759827228066.28
  it yields a fragrance as orphic as that of the pastilles of malabar    34972891656.17402
  vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips    1163350817454247.5
 but he could  arrange no schedule with the cooks    3.684978699737396e+16
 and he was glad when the trips dropped  off    4208040038004816.5
 and the botanists began to motor out by themselves    1113021780.4210155
  my friend often breakfasted with vernon on the morning of the regular  tallyho run    157101169.8605799
 this was an honor    157101169.8605799
 like dining with a captain at his private  table    8.753933616859595e+19
 vernonoffice adjoined the stable    8.753933616859595e+19
 and the walls were  adorned with brightly colored lithographs    7776869455307.677
 the folk art of the period    35153252999.217766
  they advertised harness polish    35153252999.217766
  green river whiskey    35153252999.217766
 patent medicines    35153252999.217766
  shoe blacking    35153252999.217766
 and chewing tobacco    35153252999.217766
   the hostler would have the  table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove    4232316495244.8687
 then a porter  from manningfish house would trot in with a tray on his head    7.454277320539563e+18
  it was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster  salt roast and a mound of corn fritters    4.7100761440589914e+19
 vernon was consummately fond  of oysters    70868214445226.17
 and manninghad been famous for them since the civil  war    7.967472406386608e+19
 oyster salt roast  oysters on the half shell    382671954842622.44
 cooked on a bed  of coarse salt that kept them hot when served  was a standby at manning s    1.1561480430649216e+22
  its early morning patrons were coachmen    4.338666942700949e+18
 who fortified themselves  for the day with that delicacy    538460176187827.25
   in the 1890the  palace hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager    6.905647771266897e+19
 john  c  kirkpatrick    6.905647771266897e+19
 this dish much resembles the oysters rockefeller  made famous by antoinein new orleans    1.5722122286214099e+19
 though the palace  chef announced it as a variant of manningroast oysters    1.5240471121213134e+16
  gastronomes  have long argued about which came first    7535998137682739.0
 the palaceor antoine s    7535998137682739.0
  antoineheld as mandatory a splash of absinthe or pernod  on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding    1.3068346735302765e+23
 the  kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional    2.8698115106094288e+17
  held out for plain oyster roast    2.9953103507116982e+19
 and plenty of it    2.9953103507116982e+19
 unadorned by herbs  or any seasoning but salt    2.3378620039892013e+19
 though he did fancy a bit of lemon    4.230123323437579e+19
  after the meal    4.230123323437579e+19
 he and his guests went out to inspect the rig    2.488141649560283e+19
 this  was merely a ritual    2.488141649560283e+19
 to please all hands concerned    2.488141649560283e+19
 the tallyho had  cost vernon  2    2.488141649560283e+19
 a replica of two coaches made in england for the  belmont club in the east    13431365656015.06
 and matchless west of the rockies    635800228775440.8
 it  was the despair of whips on the santa cruz run    1163543395384662.5
 one could shave in  the reflection of its french polished panels    1286144924485537.8
 and its axles were greased  like those of roulette wheels    1.1811327857048951e+20
 the horses were groomed to a high  gloss    8.183096620649175e+17
 they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw    1.0114186275838786e+17
  for they had been trained to drag at important funerals    709811709640509.4
   but  for the start of the santa cruz run    1437026.6687570703
 the whip fell    1437026.6687570703
 the clients boarded  the tallyho at the palace promptly at seven    27126900509.032017
 they had been fed  a hunting breakfast    2.6771770192254986e+18
 so called because a kedgeree    2.6771770192254986e+18
 the dish identified  with fox hunting    2518930050382082.0
 was on the bill    2518930050382082.0
 there are many ways of making a  kedgeree    207516857030416.34
 every one of which is right    3397958798462618.5
 here is an original kedgeree  recipe from the family clubkitchen    2.873007500879352e+20
    club kedgeree   flake   for three  a cupful of cold boiled haddock    1.0610907606441873e+21
 mix with a cupful of cooked  rice    1.8864022471926256e+17
 two minced hard boiled eggs    1.8864022471926256e+17
 some buttery white sauce done  with cream    1.9676452368458064e+17
 a pinch of curry    1.9676452368458064e+17
 a tablespoonful of  minced onion fried    2.324384435356938e+17
 and a bit of anchovy    2.324384435356938e+17
 heat and serve hot on toast    4509405179220382.0
      the omelet named for ernest arbogast    2.0575182880270825e+18
 the palacechef    2.0575182880270825e+18
  was even more in demand    2.0575182880270825e+18
 for decades it was the most popular dish  served in the ladies  grill at breakfast    104654857164640.45
 and it is one of the few  old palace dishes that still survive    4.527522697697618e+18
 native california oysters    4.527522697697618e+18
  salty and piquant    4.527522697697618e+18
 as coppery as delawares and not much larger than a  five cent piece    6.45248753477323e+18
 went into it    6.45248753477323e+18
 the original formula goes thus    6.45248753477323e+18
    omelet  arbogast   fry in butter a small minced onion    1.022435498495792e+17

 six beaten eggs    2.438883552108475e+17

 a teaspoonful of minced chives    2.438883552108475e+17
 a dash of cayenne    2.438883552108475e+17
 and a  pinch of nutmeg    2.438883552108475e+17

 and as the mixture  stiffens    6647042891429425.0
 in go a hundred of the little oysters    118119795559.77536
   louis sherry  once stayed a fortnight at the palace    3.1939041121638203e+19
 and he was so pleased with omelet  arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in new york    7.285514124926886e+20
  j  pierpont morgan had come in his private train to san francisco    3.745179201968728e+20
  to attend an episcopal convention    3.745179201968728e+20
 and brought the restaurateur  with him    1488133037744836.8
 as things happened    1488133037744836.8
 morgan was installed in the nob hill  residence of a magnate friend    4.8068470095457075e+17
 whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved  talent    1.3694274326935684e+22
 sherry remained in his hotel suite    9.329730715652181e+20
 where he amused himself  as best he could    2.5501331933308864e+16
 twice he left everything to his entourage    121646577893489.0
 and  fled to make the santa cruz tour under vernonguidance    11297623461818.479
  in the grand court of the palace    4819443190.762649
 notable for its tiers of moorish  galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below    53080164218172.79
 vernon station was at the entrance    4985371597887381.0
 it was a post of honor    4.327521675648922e+16
 held inviolate  for him    4.327521675648922e+16
 he had the primacy among the coachmen    993549668012980.5
 of majestic build    993549668012980.5
  rubicund and slash mouthed    993549668012980.5
 he resembled the late general winfield  scott    2003401264654220.5
 who was said to be the most imposing general of his century    119399735470840.31
  if not of all centuries    119399735470840.31
 vernon wore a gray tall hat    4.184551163285348e+18
 a gardenia    4.184551163285348e+18
  and maroon wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly    2.5356271696043633e+18
  promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in  the tallyho    156501337781.49814
 he had style    156501337781.49814
 he held his reins in a loose bunch at the  third button of his checked epsom surtout    68984665781183.28
 and when the horses leaned  at a curve    2.0389050494551408e+17
 as if bent by the force of a gale    6852123439007314.0
 he leaned with them    6852123439007314.0
  they cantered down the peninsula    6852123439007314.0
 not slackening until the coach reached  woodside where the santa cruz uplands begin    7431152898211130.0
   the road  maps of the region have changed since 1905    87817238209829.39
 inns have burned down    87817238209829.39
 moved  elsewhere    87817238209829.39
 or taken other names    87817238209829.39
 once on the road  and especially  if the passengers were all regulars and masculine     18732846816539.305
 the schedule meant  nothing    18732846816539.305
 an agreeable ease suffused vernon and the passengers of  the tallyho    328346554.03760415
 from which there issued clouds of smoke    1.6802210742047715e+17
 vernon would tilt  his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard    2.2596734297037492e+16
  indulging in a huge cigar    2.2596734297037492e+16
 the horses moved at a clump    1.2017595572090837e+20
 they were no  more on parade than was their driver    1.8419061961122906e+17
 one fork of the road was as  good as another    6.637543310958759e+19
 the santa cruz mountains sprawl over three counties    3.5825516651424625e+20
  and the roads twist through sky tapping redwoods down whose furrowed  columns ripple streams of rain    3.285811667118921e+17
 even when heat bakes the santa clara  valley below at the left    1.8921404283499668e+16
 the water splashes into shoulder high tracts  of fernery    5.715727961757654e+21
 you arrive there in seersucker    5.715727961757654e+21
 and feel you were half witted  not to bring a mackintosh    1.5072986644230084e+16
   vernon kept an account book  with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage    4.9508880325680083e+17
  a number of them must have fallen into disfavor    5597579427502920.0
 they were  struck out with remarks in red ink    6.76387420343307e+17
 denouncing both the cooks and the  management    216142525.3999891
 he was copious in his praise of those that served food that  was good to eat    2.8001937867361284e+16
 the horses seemed to know these by instinct    5125264387796184.0
 he used  to say    5125264387796184.0
 such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins    1.1665644780928197e+21
  there was wright s    1.1665644780928197e+21
 for one    1.1665644780928197e+21
 lost amongst trees    1.1665644780928197e+21
 its wide  verandas strewn with rockers    1.30859189413377e+18
 many of its sojourners were devoted  to seclusion and quiet    5766818668968156.0
 and lived there to the end of their days    50407604545.96032
 it  was  the haunt of writer ambrose bierce    1.043704862225492e+16
 who admired its redwoods    1.043704862225492e+16
 acorns  from the great oaks fed the small black pigs  akin to berkshires     18851238966061.887
  whose  carcass sweepstakes  were renowned    18851238966061.887
 their ham butts    18851238966061.887
 cured  in oak log smoke    18851238966061.887
 were also esteemed when roasted or boiled    1.0724787339374576e+17
 and served  with this original sauce    3.4359979304373494e+18
    wrightdevil sauce   put into  a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy    286879078328.07294
 or of the boiled ham liquor    6018491477910.057
  with a half stick of butter    1141610227838762.0
 three teaspoonfuls of made mustard    1141610227838762.0
  and two mashed garlic cloves    1141610227838762.0
 contribute also an onion    1141610227838762.0
 a peeled tomato  and two pickled gherkins    105155424422632.97
 and a mashed lime    105155424422632.97
 after this has simmered  an hour    1.6066840359773804e+16
 add two tablespoons each of worcestershire    8.805497272425117e+16
 and  chutney    8.805497272425117e+16
 two pickled walnuts    8.805497272425117e+16
 and a pint of sherry    8.805497272425117e+16
 then simmer fifteen  minutes longer    8.805497272425117e+16
     every winter a kegful of this sauce was made  and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar    195657051512994.88
 so  that when its turn came    8.427763275079378e+18
 it was properly mellowed    8.427763275079378e+18
   vineyards  and orchards also grew around wright s    100266445633159.25
 and deer were rather a nuisance    6.416523279090879e+20
  they leaped six foot fences with the agility of panthers    1.8073839311364983e+19
 but  no one complained when they wound up    5.215567355222444e+18
 regardless of season    5.215567355222444e+18
 in venison  pies    5.215567355222444e+18
 no one complained of the white wine either    8308770869.2038355

 grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint    3714697803105.351

 you can t  build hotei in a couple of weeks    26260642598958.812
 our building time was slightly  over 400 hours  but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom    4.212780031984851e+17
 head and hardware was under  800    1.4282132296096566e+20
 a comparable manufactured  boat would cost close to  3    7.204419038824257e+19
 consider what you have to earn to be  able to spend the  3    72531055165.27335
000 and your building time is well worth it    3.014054653572608e+18

  this piece of equipment costs a little over  600 but it will save  you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years    8594866759214692.0
   all framing  in hotei is one inch mahogany which    69245138959333.336
 in the dressed state you  buy it    447994467154008.2
 is about the 13 16 inch thickness specified in the drawings    1420206921086.961
  the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens    3.14962255050336e+20
 on a table saw    3.14962255050336e+20
 besides flathead bronze screws    3.14962255050336e+20
 silicon bronze  stronghold nails  made by independent nail   packing co     7.827286313596675e+18
 mass   are used extensively in assembly and weldwood  resorcinal glue is used in all the joints    2.3659626815430984e+18
    construction   follows a thorough study of the drawings    1.8880954741145047e+19
 start by laying out the six  frames and the transom on a level floor    2261110696756.233
 draw each outline in a different color  chalk    3.0115179052677326e+20
 one on top of the other    70278960910.12225
 in this way you will be  able to detect any obvious mistakes    27415463232127.887
   the transom frame is made  first with the joints lapped    7.562995574348738e+18
 glued and fastened with one inch    3.631924874671351e+19
 no   12 stronghold nails    3.631924874671351e+19
 after notching it for the keelson    19738268049532.8
 chines and  battens    19738268049532.8
 the half inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue  and the same type  nails    40848513599851.445
 all frames are butted at the joints and 3 8 inch plywood gussets  are glued and nailed on each side of each joint    240742893767940.88
 again using the one inch    240742893767940.88
  no  12 nails    240742893767940.88
 the frames are notched only for the keelson  and the chines    2020828417934691.5
 if notched for the battens    2020828417934691.5
 they would require more work    2020828417934691.5
  be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge  water could flow through    3.7615421447862106e+17
 nowhere in the boat do the frames come in  contact with the plywood planking    3759378870573282.5
   the jig is erected after the  frames and transom are complete    2633337860994940.0
 this is an important step because  any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull  as you advance in construction    2.06187867153531e+16
 be sure all members are parallel    2.3001734700747853e+20
  vertical and level as required    2.3001734700747853e+20
   after the frames and transom  are set up on the jig and temporarily braced    22539397589880.984
 a piece of three inch wide  mahogany  only widths will be given since the 13 16 inch thickness  is used throughout  is butted between frames one and two below the line  of the keelson    449461338744220.56
 the frames are glued and screwed to this piece    1.3372856395974504e+17
 the  joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin saturated  fiberglas cloth and nailed    2635610845949454.5
 it is over this piece that the  laminated stem and keelson are spliced    1871887377714736.8
   the keelson    1871887377714736.8
 made of  two three inch widths    5699224180669439.0
 is next installed    5699224180669439.0
 the first piece is glued  and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames  one and two    4728385262421237.0
 the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the  first    46499681049316.16
 that it is six inches shorter at the forward end    3.74865508378347e+18
  one inch    3.74865508378347e+18
 no  10 screws are used in both cases    2165487748972325.0
    a stem  jig  is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to  frame one    2.694217690764883e+16
 the stem is laminated from four pieces    4.52266446082604e+20
 take two three inch wide  pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make  the four    73168696549.30124
 then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and  bend them into place on the jig    5.304128544775691e+19
 the first two pieces butt against  the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace  between the first two frames    1591989.0356339903
 the second two pieces lap over the inner  member of the keelson and butt against the outer member    62214067319282.49
 they re  glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson    191932163.36701083
 a number of  c  clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets    375371390382.8951
  all bottom battens are two inches wide    3061458206061161.0
 the side ones are a half inch  narrower    1.0016307303644478e+20
 the battens are carefully fastened in place after some  necessary fairing on all frames    4.863273082991515e+20
 glue and 1 1 2 inch    1.6417719043419901e+18
 no  10 screws  are used    1.6417719043419901e+18
 placement is important because the rear seat    8.366411579915387e+18
 bunks and  front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens    91990247685.94162
  with the exception of two battens    3030190443.4876337
 all run to the stem where they  are glued and screwed after careful beveling    4.5185472663231494e+17
 the chines go in the same  way except that they are made of two pieces of two inch wood for strength  and easier bending    9.729029737852402e+17
   fairing is always a tedious job but  the work can be cut down considerably with a skill planer and a simple  jig    3.344318620580898e+20
 i clamped a 30 inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer  with a pair of sure grips    2361836798118.676
 the aluminum    2361836798118.676
 flush against the battens    2361836798118.676
  acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson  to the proper bevels easily    290005954119664.7
 if you don t own a planer and don t  want to buy one    7.389554451473816e+16
 itwell worth renting    7.389554451473816e+16
    the planking   is five ply    7.389554451473816e+16
 3 8 inch thick weldwood royal marine plywood    5.7304622732649306e+17
 this  can be obtained in 42 inch widths 24 feet long    1.8595262322599283e+18
 the 42 inch width  leaves very little waste    5.366502886680454e+16
 four pieces are used    5.366502886680454e+16
 plank the sides first    5.366502886680454e+16
  using glue and one inch    5.366502886680454e+16
 no  12 stronghold nails at all battens    5135142425152606.0
  the stem and the transom    5135142425152606.0
 another person inside with a weight against  each batten will help in the fastening    3.543265571102951e+18
 the best procedure is to  have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off    1.6573066656632528e+17
  then trim the excess    1.6573066656632528e+17
 i used a homemaster routo jig made by porter  cable for this job    2.3389640624869482e+17
 itgood for cutting all the planking because  it cuts with a bit like blade at high  rpm and does not chatter  the plywood like a saber saw    4.117144517658817e+19
   when cut    4.117144517658817e+19
 the planking is clamped  in place for a final and careful trimming    5.726001412240031e+18
 then it is marked on the  inside where it comes in contact with the transom    1.3187126138723069e+17
 keelson and  all the battens    1.3187126138723069e+17
 it may then be pre drilled for the fastenings    1.7358192349080965e+19
 the  next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at  the contact points    7.700496308923446e+19
 then it is replaced and fastened    1.0782278267009096e+16
 the bottom planking  is applied in the same manner    1071778060329896.2
   after planking    1071778060329896.2
 the bottom  gets a layer of fiberglas    48080078163288.86
 the spray rails are first glued on the  outside and fastened from the inside with screws    63355100368770.24
 then the chines are  rounded off and the bottom is rough sanded in preparation    181579435076532.9
 since the  sides are also covered up to the spray rails    379069092262.5185
 they are also rough sanded  in that area    2495084768147120.5
 the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at  a time    42009382344.337425
 a 50 inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line  by about three inches    7.113337807141174e+17
 lay the cloth in place and trim it to size    7.572919293677999e+17
  then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin    6.67466695154768e+17
 when the resin  has hardened    6.67466695154768e+17
 mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish    1.596523600305514e+18
  i used bright red    1.596523600305514e+18
 mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding  the hardener    2.656295578269206e+18
 using a cheap brush    2.656295578269206e+18
 coat one side of the bottom with  the resin and then apply the cloth    10800670164700.111
 when the cloth is smooth    10800670164700.111
 apply  another coat of resin    10800670164700.111
 spreading it with a paint roller    4.3920905158291113e+18

   you can build this vacation cottage yourself    245098592828801.22
 it is a full scale    245098592828801.22
  but efficient house that can become a year  round retreat complete  in every detail    1.6834407066675312e+17
 because of the unique design by the architect egils  hermanovski    212149496778128.62
 you can build most of it in your own home workshop  in your spare time    3.769490736437302e+21
 most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials    4194613803255077.0
  and requires the use of only simple tools    5.714737738867054e+17
 on the following  pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to  your vacation cottage    4.303623664680547e+16
 from choosing the proper site to applying the  final trim     1.8672762487243136e+16
  in recognition of the growing trend for second homes    64621369162.74197
  or vacation cottages    64621369162.74197
 we have designed this one specifically with  the family handyman in mind    232343513803.39014
 it is a big project    232343513803.39014
 not to be taken lightly    232343513803.39014
  but each step has been broken down into easy stages    3.358410155424696e+20
 utilizing  standard materials and simple tools    2.926211874462137e+20
 well within the capabilities of the  handyman    707962.4530864846
    the theory   the idea behind our design is modular units    3.855128591994542e+20
  or panelization    3.855128591994542e+20
 everything possible has been scaled to standard  sizes and measurements of materials    2259902423824.943
 wall panels and structural timbers  are standard as are windows and doors    6126683338556001.0
 making for a minimum of cutting    629102206540167.0
  we have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so  that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop    3.513847425395601e+17
  panel by panel    3.513847425395601e+17
 according to plan    3.513847425395601e+17
 when you have prepared your  foundation and laid the floor    1.0286502414955951e+20
 these can be trucked to the site and erected  with a small crew of friends in a weekend    1.6382606071339289e+19
 the roof timbers are  precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed  in a matter of three or four days    1.9752043128489176e+16
 then you can do the finishing  touches at your leisure    2680752492617993.0
    a warning   due to the fact that building  codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country    333725498824148.94
 the first  thing to do is to find out what    1.082930214513899e+16
 if any    1.082930214513899e+16
 they are    1.082930214513899e+16
 close to a large  city they might even specify the size of the nails used    7.006437718078235e+16
 in a remote  section there might be no restrictions at all    7.069810524190083e+18
 this can usually  be found out at the nearest town hall    6.8071088282498696e+16
 at the same time check the electrical    352035496187434.75
 and sanitary requirements    352035496187434.75
 as well as possible zoning  regulations    1.0221006435133044e+16
 whether electricity and public water and sewers are available  or not    7.490981058898989e+18
 check the local customs in the use of bottled or  l p  gas  we give you alternatives later on     5982866137636.223
 be sure that this information  is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion    9.72264079901314e+19
 if there  are any major restrictions    1.724448873623891e+18
 they usually can be obtained in printed  form    8.364454696026886e+17
 where a building permit is required    1.8593217021302016e+18
 find out what you must  present when applying for one    4.0307301595600755e+17
 in many cases    4.0307301595600755e+17
 you must file a complete  set of plans with the local building inspector    267908069938.7147
 these will be available  at cost from our plans department    1.2532082535824185e+19
    the site   some general  things to look for in a site    4.389724356472818e+18
 if you haven t already bought one    63859355508345.69
 are  accessibility    63859355508345.69
 water drainage    63859355508345.69
 and orientation    63859355508345.69
 how are the roads    63859355508345.69
  and how will they stand up    9.694870475994962e+17
 is there evidence of wash outs on the property    23632947719227.68
  swampy areas or intermittent springs    23632947719227.68
 a visit in the early  spring after a thaw will be very informative    571973179136390.5
 note where the sun rises  and sets    6009957010031.326
 and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms  come from    360759946888076.8
 will the view be something you can live with    1935632908138190.2
 don t  worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain    2.563975971211629e+17
 we will take up alternative  foundations later on    1.4069270751482034e+17
    the materials   with this first issue  we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic   a  version  and the expandable   b version     51341317.332842946
 this will be  for the  shell of the house only   roof    7390469145.318905
 and floor     7390469145.318905
 and does not include  the carport or balcony    5.48239227286356e+19
 this will permit you to get a  rough   estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost    482908269316.65454
 bear in mind  that this does  not  include interior panels for partitions    9.920017673240485e+23
 fancy  flooring    9.920017673240485e+23
 appliances and fixtures    9.920017673240485e+23

 and plumbing    9.920017673240485e+23
  all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues    3.208185606397507e+18
   the  wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard   f and   f of  a good grade    1.5638214393313864e+19
 free from structural faults    1.5638214393313864e+19
 they should be as straight  as possible    6.527430249517946e+16
 as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when  the walls are erected    105221306.87809484
 the outside surface of the solid units shall  be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood    1.5170370962535635e+19
 plastic coated  panel board    1.5170370962535635e+19
 high density particle board    1.5170370962535635e+19
 asbestos cement board    1.5170370962535635e+19
 or  any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building  supply dealer    2.4012361065686828e+16
 the inner panels do not have to be weatherproof    5.124130065494715e+21
 and  the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired    6213713963.713239
 all panel  board comes in standard   f foot size    4.736349693803945e+21
 it is recommended that panels  be both glued as well as nailed to the frame    6147971198908247.0
 the fixed window panels  with louvers should have a good grade of 1 8 inch double strength glass  set in a mastic glazing compound    5.5825348580458125e+17
 the louvers are constructed as  shown in the detail    2.8819364414532333e+17
 with a drop door for ventilation    7.000867436385576e+21
 there are standard  sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels  requiring them    4.075598644701939e+20
 the door panels are designed to accommodate standard  doors which should be of exterior grade    3.817821289401986e+16
 the filler panels for the gable  ends are cut from full   f sheets as shown    4.152477723914375e+19
 leaving no wastage    4.152477723914375e+19
 the  battens covering the joints are of   f stock and are applied after  the walls are erected    2713752636441.3564
 all nails should be rustproof    2713752636441.3564
 and aluminum is  highly recommended    2713752636441.3564
 if 1 2 inch panel board is used inside  and out    3.8725100916828496e+19
 or 5 8 inch one side and 3 8 inch the other    4.1578660976767917e+17
 and 1 8 inch glass  is used    1.7047038574874313e+19
 stock lumber in   f    1.7047038574874313e+19
 and   f can be used in making the  glass panels    5270717164673624.0
 other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special  size lumber for the glass trim    1.2137844801636974e+18
 in any case    1.2137844801636974e+18
 there is no special milling  or rabbeting required for the panels    5.625706405216935e+20
  with modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting  tools    275507032209.5879
 and attachments available    275507032209.5879
 the drill press has become  a basic home workshop tool    6.092618193037986e+19
 the drill press consists of a vertical  shaft  spindle  which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a  drill chuck    1.7770341571232644e+16
 a tubular housing  quill  in which the spindle is mounted    3.4374355227724585e+18
  a head in which the quill is mounted    1.2257961815756678e+16
 a feed lever which moves the  quill up or down    8.638600968590048e+19
 a power source    8.638600968590048e+19
 and a movable table upon which the work  is placed    3.3819872459716896e+22
 there is often a means of locking the quill and    1.7056968620622035e+17
 on larger  presses    1.7056968620622035e+17
 the table can be tilted    1.7056968620622035e+17
   the size of the press is  usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity  the maximum diameter tool  shank it will hold  or distance between the spindle center and the  column    5437051412432.354
 a press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center  of a 22 inch board or circle    338078043713561.7
   a new radial drill press with  a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done  at any angle    289915678644752.56
 the head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on  the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work    1.841521088141895e+16
    set up and maintenance   the drill press should be leveled and    8.484463353595408e+19
 depending  on whether it is a bench or floor model    1.5609255078008162e+19
 bolted securely to a  sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws    2514234010367712.5
  this will reduce vibration and increase accuracy    5.307492780757712e+19
   a coat  of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the  polished surface of the table    287452317878.3211
 wiping with a slightly oiled cloth  will discourage rusting of the column and quill    499441268030.4116
 presses not fitted  with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in  the lubrication holes in the quill    67195955610140.336
 the rest of the press should be kept  clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush    1.6436144260271708e+18
   be careful to  keep the drive belt free of oil and grease    381730470014661.7
 belt tension is adjusted  by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount    13764733104054.336
 keep  the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won t slip when pulled by  hand    3565493942941749.0
 excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle  bearings    32480734451.47697
 most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises  the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds  the quill in the raised position    195026493851157.1
 the return spring tension may be  adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing  with a pair of pliers  to prevent the spring from unwinding when it  is released     4.148721255369973e+18
 loosening the lock nut or screw    6.634455766600681e+17
 and rotating the housing  until the desired tension is achieved    587881649351714.4
 turning the housing clockwise  will reduce tension    7.913509926509741e+17
 counter clockwise will increase it    7.913509926509741e+17
    don t  lose the chuck key   some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide  a socket for the chuck key    3.0678320155594816e+17
 you ll have to spend  a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the  press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the  bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not  in use    26425117088167.918
    feeds and speeds   drill speeds are important if you want  a good job    4.860447926094951e+18
 each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed    6.797290732219478e+20
  depending on the material worked    6.797290732219478e+20
 on most drill presses    6.797290732219478e+20
 it is impossible  to get the exact speed    842203540956.6165
 but you can come close by adjusting the  drive belt on the step cone pulleys    1.659350369275413e+18
 you will find a chart giving the  various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere  in the instruction booklet that came with the tool    4325537051186194.5
 see the table  on page 34 for exact recommended speeds    1.390999758638793e+18
 the larger the  tool and the harder the material    7684616155520966.0
 the slower the speed    7684616155520966.0
   feed pressure  is also of major importance    723450743819337.5
 too much pressure will force the  tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed  or broken tools    2.920935763546132e+21
 too light a feed    2.920935763546132e+21
 particularly with metal or other hard  material    4.479750934297514e+17
 causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting  edge    70060441528294.695
 the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed  with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even  rate    6.9170722666303016e+16
    common drilling tools   there are numerous types and styles  of tools to drill holes    1.1862386573257893e+17
 the most common are the twist drill    418041267642958.8
 the  solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades    1.0878046499704601e+22
 the double spur  bit    1.0878046499704601e+22
 and the power wood bit    1.0878046499704601e+22
 all will do a good job if sharp    6.358708535145528e+19
 but the  twist drills don t cut quite as smoothly as the others    4320948532628103.5
 since they  do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual  boring starts    2.3051441747506443e+20
   the adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting  large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact size discs by  reversing the cutter blade    7.573424062575325e+22
 since fly cutters are one sided and not  balanced    2.889671604785906e+16
 they should be used at the slowest speed available    448936710468945.25
 and fed  very slowly to avoid binding    2605793095092933.0
 fly cutters can fool you into putting  your hand too close to the tool    2.412750176965236e+24
 so if you want to avoid nicked fingers    20521577635209.35
  keep your hands well out of the way    1.4703881236194237e+21
    simple hole drilling operations    when drilling all the way through a workpiece    32537677573859.035
 always place a  piece of scrap wood underneath    4829723836908569.0
 this will not only protect the work  table    2451864109467096.0
 but also assure a clean breakthrough    8.604111313640186e+17
 another method of assuring  a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through    2.2546939925056694e+22
  then drill half way with the dimensional bit    1.834376210693365e+16
 turn the piece over    1.834376210693365e+16
  and finish from the other side    47494065830646.91
 in soft woods with pronounced grain    8.989662812394231e+17
  there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander    9.056630730853109e+23
 due to the varying  hardness of the wood    7659452153.846409
 in this case    7659452153.846409
 drilling a small pilot hole or  clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy    3.959426021781038e+16
   when a hole  is to be bored to a predetermined depth    100769215762429.38
 mark the depth on the side  of the stock    36976976235.26538
 then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark    2.966176039604202e+17
  the depth gauge rod can now be set    1.2476158858687402e+16
 and any number of holes bored to  exact and identical depth    20600128348629.426
  the old time bridges over the merrimac river in massachusetts  are of unusual interest in many respects    2.0745760944789217e+19
 for their length    2.0745760944789217e+19
 their  types of construction    2.0745760944789217e+19
 their picturesque settings    2.0745760944789217e+19
 and their literary  associations    2.0745760944789217e+19
 they should be known and remembered    1287851357205678.0
 in this sequence  i shall write about them in the order of their erection    110256956102531.38
   the  first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part    4.971850435701859e+16
  and perhaps  the most interesting one    5.060163716204534e+18
 connected newbury  now newburyport  with  salisbury point    2.7772396795802067e+19
 its building was first proposed in 1791    1.203431516267577e+20
 when a  group of citizens    1.203431516267577e+20
 mostly newburyport men    1.203431516267577e+20
 petitioned the general court  for an act of incorporation    35528976898090.32
 this document began    35528976898090.32
   no   1 newbury port    35528976898090.32
 may 30th    35528976898090.32
 1791     whereas    35528976898090.32
 a bridge over  merrimack river    35528976898090.32
 from the land of hon ble jonathan greenleaf    46443934211241.95
 in newbery    46443934211241.95
 to deer island    46443934211241.95
 and from said island to salisbury    3.666327684107661e+18
  would be of very extensive utility    3.12250717502473e+20
 by affording a safe conveyance  to carriages    5.846800436191431e+18
 teams  and travellers at all seasons of the year    184318084824979.72
  and at all times of tide    411552765704977.6
 the subscribers    411552765704977.6
 do agree    411552765704977.6
  that as soon as a convenient number of persons have subscribed to  this    35745677127302.445
 or a similar writing    35745677127302.445
 we will present a petition to the hon ble  general court of the commonwealth of massachusetts    1321083540.7018096
 praying  for an act incorporating into a body politic the subscribers to such  writing with liberty to build such a bridge    2.232502679300301e+18
 and a right to demand  a toll equal to that received at malden bridge    9.407075492874168e+17
 and on like terms    9.407075492874168e+17
  and if such an act shall be obtained    1.6112159022358594e+19
 then we severally agree each  with the others    4.573867464379801e+18
 that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares  set against our respective names    1.0800807673264835e+23
 the whole into two hundred shares  being divided    3.552618353496929e+20
 and that we will pay such sums of money at such times  and in such manners    4.952498471940815e+17
 as by the said proposed corporation    1446313961045864.0
 shall  be directed and required     1446313961045864.0
   this paper was signed by forty five  persons    7.043728816494928e+18
 subscribing a total of two hundred shares    109947779635982.73
   a month  later the general court served notice to the town of newbury that  the bridge was to be built    8.216613674614554e+16
 the matter was considered and reconsidered    2.373148523529824e+18
  and finally opposed    2.373148523529824e+18
 but in spite of many objections    86920120108574.05
 the court  granted a charter on january 9    5930263651089852.0
 on november 26 of that year the  bridge was completed and opened    2643063490641.0674
   timothy palmer    2643063490641.0674
 who invented  and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges    44903918693429.984
  was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the essex    1416123351850.0942
  or  deer island  bridge although the actual work was carried  out under the direction of william coombs    25041156695.341576
 who received   300 as  recompense    25041156695.341576
  this two part bridge is best described by rev  timothy  dwight    2.348839450260319e+16
 president of yale college    2.348839450260319e+16
 in his  travels in new england  and new york     7.938915275432289e+17
 published in new haven in 1821    2.4023535602894134e+17
 he says  of it    2.4023535602894134e+17
    it consists of two divisions    2.4023535602894134e+17
 separated by an island  at a small distance from the southern shore    882378962691159.4
 the division between  the island and this shore    1531078408.376401
 consists principally of an arch    1531078408.376401
 whose  chord is one hundred and sixty feet    6.684264006623431e+23
 and whose vortex is forty feet  it  was actually 37 feet  above the high water mark    579070242979932.1
 in appearance and  construction it resembles the pascataqua bridge    1.0164589024560938e+17
 the whole length of  essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty four    3.2112436135270054e+17
  i have already mentioned that mr  timothy palmer of newburyport  was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country    2183814988.577222
 as mr   palmer was educated to house building only    7.401270452796349e+19
 and had never seen a  structure of this nature    2.1151876009617513e+18
 he certainly deserves not a little credit  for the invention     3.935387901326946e+19
   it is hardly necessary to remind students  of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in 1751 in nearby  rowley    5.158329536456309e+18
 that he moved with his parents to west boxford when he was  sixteen years old    1.3637102791641971e+17
 and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect    3.364909190941755e+17
  moody spofford    3.364909190941755e+17
 it was indeed a remarkable feat that a man  who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the  principle of the arch    85410676208158.33
 which appears in his famous bridges at portsmouth    3.5497675875963496e+20
 and philadelphia    3.5497675875963496e+20
   the essex merrimack bridge  when first built was not covered    1.7409395956259383e+21
 as far as we know    1.7409395956259383e+21
 no american  bridge had been thus protected in 1792    3.0344653606775456e+16
 richard s  allen is the  authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed  by 1810    3.4097892365527127e+18
 its original appearance is shown in an engraving published  in the  massachusetts magazine  in may 1793    1.0617691620955282e+20
 which is reproduced  herewith  fig  1     9.877364092113705e+20
 a brief description accompanying the picture  says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber    1.87896197966069e+20
 between  the abutments on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island  there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet    5.617754353146922e+18
 between the north  shore of deer island and the salisbury side there was an arch of  113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long    3.279840348051689e+18
   a  dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place  july 4    8588313033.53108
 in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island    1.8130633706819416e+16
  it is said that the eccentric timothy dexter    1006891491817807.0
 who was one of the  first share holders    258371361771.93396
 stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the  occasion    18150537614290.816
 the  essex journal  says that he  delivered an oration  on the bridge    523569468299724.0
 which for elegance of style    523569468299724.0
 propriety of speech  or force of argument    7203870906397.872
 was truly ciceronian     7203870906397.872
 the reporter must have  written this with tongue in cheek    1.4942902455253903e+18
 because dexteroration could  hardly be understood    1.4942902455253903e+18
 although he later explained that he was  talking french    6.978114722529331e+17
 it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to  the joys of the evening    527666933035.2393
   the north portion of the essex bridge  was well worth the cost of construction    1.978651224030951e+21
 although it proved to be twice  what was estimated in the beginning    134473026998915.44
 it stood in its original form  until 1882    1.713018378663172e+18
 the southern half    1.713018378663172e+18
 on account of its underbracing    1.713018378663172e+18
  was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation    4.4212737926606515e+18
 in 1810 it  was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge    2.935981197835713e+19
 this was built  by john templeman from plans submitted by james finley of fayette  county    1.4637720295293535e+18
 timothy palmer had general supervision  of the work    51825057924921.16
   an advertisement in the  newburyport herald     4.986828183609845e+16
  december 21    4.986828183609845e+16
 shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain  bridges    5.934240394574138e+19
 it reads    5.934240394574138e+19
   chain bridges     information  is hereby given that mr  timothy palmer of newburyport    1.7697390223039763e+17
 mass   has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the patentees of the  chain bridge    90822659927459.67
 in the states of massachusetts    90822659927459.67
 new hampshire    90822659927459.67
  rhode island    90822659927459.67
 and connecticut    90822659927459.67
 so far as relates to the sale  of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges    56810031540936.59
    mr   palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if  desired will view the proposed site    5.069643909078442e+19
 and lay out and superintend the  work    2.0583388609314358e+18
 or recommend a suitable person to execute it    8.335073323184539e+17
   john  templeman   approved    8.335073323184539e+17
 timothy palmer    this chain bridge proved  less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end    256263299689298.38
 it fell    256263299689298.38
  february 6    256263299689298.38
 carrying with it a horse and wagon    638769324515295.5
 two men and four  oxen    638769324515295.5
 the horse and men were saved    29900253115671.508
 but the oxen drowned    29900253115671.508
 in spite  of this catastrophe    29900253115671.508
 the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened  again on july 17    2.1456259366698585e+20
 this second chain bridge was 570 feet long    8.153000114010436e+18
  had two thirty foot towers and a draw    2038577492539843.2
 and a double roadway    2038577492539843.2
  the essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868    1.7280239308516164e+21
 when the county  commissioners laid out all the merrimack bridges as highways    1.2440426571021189e+17
  sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous  use    2.0093468766703104e+19
 the old covered    2.0093468766703104e+19
 wooden bridge that spans the tygartis valley river  at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week long observance  of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site    2.735238594514039e+21
 may  28th to june 3rd    2.735238594514039e+21
 colonel frederick w  lander    2.735238594514039e+21
  will again make his break neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott  now college  hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel  benjamin f  kelley west  virginia infantry    4.30925902211295e+16
 then swarming  through the streets in pursuit of the retreating confederates    10250854304.64083
  he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops  thus the  old bridge has another distinction    1.2331091589720637e+18
 that of being the first such structure  secured by force of arms in the war of the  60s    317866119604.65765
   the  bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements    2555760688154.7764
  and floods    2555760688154.7764
 as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic    482126847415507.9
 for more than  a hundred years    9.853540514160068e+19
 twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction  by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister    8063575901398605.0
  it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the  last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic  on u s  route 250  the old beverly and fairmont turnpike    20704239648812.953
  it is one of the very few    142183732234.9655
 if not the only surviving bridge of  its type to serve a main artery of the u s  highway system    77626913617775.45
 thus  it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days    23056805183.39752
   this  covered    23056805183.39752
 wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action  in the early morning of june 3    1765950821661.4473
 and with subsequent troop movements  of both armies in the philippi area that it has become a part  and parcel of the war story    2997172130718551.5
 so frequently has pictures of the bridge  appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the  old john brown fort at harpers ferry as the two nationally best known  structures in west virginia    1.381359481220211e+17
   completed and opened for traffic  in 1852    9.923721501324714e+16
 the bridge was designed and built by lemuel chenoweth  and his brother    1711080815546851.0
 of beverly    1711080815546851.0
 the chenoweth brothers were experienced  bridge builders    2.180674005894165e+17
 and against the competition of other    15668146885.299023
 and better  known    15668146885.299023
 bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of  the covered    52796314389.3589
 wooden bridges on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike  a dozen years before    1.0839036654171902e+21
 as well as many other bridges for several counties    1.4942164344767386e+17
  the philippi bridge    1.4942164344767386e+17
 was the chenoweth master piece    1.4942164344767386e+17
  with its 139 foot    1.4942164344767386e+17
 dual lane    1.4942164344767386e+17
 span  and it stands today as a monument  to its builders    4.0472772917767616e+17
 never rebuilt    4.0472772917767616e+17
 the bridge was strengtened in 1938  by two extra piers    1.1497069208412482e+21
 a concrete floor    1.1497069208412482e+21
 and a walk way along the upper  side in order to care for modern traffic    2388832634971944.0
   during the war it  was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the  railhead at grafton to the troops operating in the interior    113221421641.36897
 union  soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the  rain or other inclement weather    3901326547937.447
 and some of them left momentoes of their  stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams    1.1371786670303695e+19
  but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened  when brigadier general william e   grumble  jones reached philippi  while on the famous jones imboden raid in may    6605671414609.816
 general  jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings    692434511239499.0
 including the  long bridge at fairmont    4.4968404189269446e+17
 after seeing a great drove of horses  and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge    438915831062.12164
 he sent his men  to work piling combustibles in and around it    1.6588059616941092e+18
 reverend joshual corder    1.6588059616941092e+18
  a baptist minister    1.6588059616941092e+18
 gathered a few citizens of southern sympathies    1.3719532837375524e+16
  to call on jones and plead with him to spare the structure    1.1186577669332624e+16
 he  reasoned and argued    1.1186577669332624e+16
 pointing out that jones or other confederate  commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat    2.407571295614736e+16
 jones  relented    2.407571295614736e+16
 he did not order his men to apply the torch  the drove of  livestock was driven up the valley    2.275028565843524e+19
 via beverly    2.275028565843524e+19
 and across the mountains  to feed and serve the confederate army    3065750436142.5723
 while jones and his raiders  turned toward buckhannon to join forces with imboden    1.2572978642951438e+16
  again reverend corder saved the bridge when union soldiers planned  to destroy it    1226625148532.1907
 after filling its two lanes with hay and straw  but  for what reason is not recorded nor remembered    1.554961737984402e+20
 certainly not because  of pressure from an opposing confederate force    3.553258639861722e+17
 on the second occasion  it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their  purpose    582475976575.9348
   centering around this historic old structure    5.280618978643824e+19
 a group  of public spirited barbour county citizens have organized and planned  a week long series of events    2.3555649407431086e+19
 beginning on may 28th and continuing  through june 3rd    589555055211174.9
 to observe most appropriately the centennial of  the first land engagement of the civil war at philippi    14621863716851.955
  it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming  pool  eight enlightening    1.541686476327231e+22
 not wholly unrewarding  years    1.541686476327231e+22
 we have learned a lot  a dash of hydrochemistry here    7.417082664616224e+18
 a  bit about plumbing and pump priming there    1.9894571371696584e+16
 we have had sound grounding  in the principles of the mailed fist in velvet glove school of diplomacy    4.3865006657153257e+20
  we have become amateur insurance experts and fine feathered yard  birds    1.192421644287916e+21
 our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of  our neighbors have built their own pools    2.6480665577769298e+20
 thereby diluting our spectacular  attractions    2.6480665577769298e+20
 but problems cling to pools    2.6480665577769298e+20
 as any pool owner knows    2.6480665577769298e+20
  so our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials    1.6502527541100265e+19
  errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the  first time  in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience    6.2394382283168035e+22
    where to put it   position may not be everything    1.5710119144085852e+16
 but in the  case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties    6.281424979193355e+20
 social and or  physical    6.281424979193355e+20
 we speak from varying viewpoints    6.281424979193355e+20
 one of us has a pool set  in a wooded area very near the house    7.737798571911542e+19
 the other has his pool far away  from the house in a field high on a hill    3.7509256177088947e+18
   if you are dreaming  of a blue    8663955694034.905
 shimmering pool right outside your living room windows    5.717247994694827e+23
  close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of  children    7.33965483712963e+16
 damp towels    7.33965483712963e+16
 squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi inflated  plastic toys    66656137686773.984
 you are likely to be nearer the truth    24927677729731.668
   you can  also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living  quarters    1.6562733497708076e+21
 the greater the chance for violation of family privacy    1.3652664361936596e+16
 annoying  noise and the let s make your house our club attitude    4.2844161885467275e+21
 on the  other hand    4.2844161885467275e+21
 out of sight does not lead to out of mind when children  cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the  pool    2.6161412472185456e+17
   another dilemma    2.6161412472185456e+17
 as picturesque as a sylvan pond in  the forest may be    2111025884972309.2
 trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well being  of a pool    3.444218230011568e+16
 yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating  lawn every time the grass is mowed    836442717206695.4
   as in choosing a wife    836442717206695.4
 it  is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be  in bad weather as well as in good    4651257897960673.0
 in the colder climes    4651257897960673.0
 for instance    4651257897960673.0
  you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when  your pool will hardly look its best    6.191661088433623e+21
 it may be a big hole in the ground  filled with salt hay    1431257202126892.8
 or an ice floe studded with logs    7.622104127232069e+19
 even a  neat    7.622104127232069e+19
 plastic covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold    3.7747996926504166e+17
  we do    3.7747996926504166e+17
 recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk   flora and fauna generally  from accidentally wintering in the  pool    1818510424620810.0
    probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts    8.89870113400376e+19
  naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and  size of your land    1.2373612860064002e+19
 but if space and money are no problem and small children  are not on hand every day    1.2650516329483837e+18
 it is certainly more restful to have  your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs  of the house    45297498426035.8
 and a good several feet around the pool should be neither  greensward nor woods    6693488296670946.0
 but good hard pavement    6693488296670946.0
   the placement  of your pool    6693488296670946.0
 will not of itself solve the two major problems  of pool owning  those that involve your social life and those pertaining  to safety    1.2844713816209377e+22
 coping with them demands stern discipline  of yourself  as well as of your family    6929664761367.591
 friends and anyone you ever  talked to on a transoceanic jet    1011887914497824.9
   eight years ago while we were  going through the mud sweat and tears construction period    6657331776767.282
 we were  each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home comings  to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid  out nearby for the lord and masterdelectation    2.250914989580982e+17
 but not even our  first pool side  gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies    1.2057748875083426e+19
  we seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own  backyards    1.269085408789841e+18
 our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled    1.3500945334165249e+22
  had we taken a lien on a state park    2.861106373510591e+19
 not at all    2.861106373510591e+19
 we had merely been  discovered by the pool sharks    2.4763849443834834e+21
 we were in business    2.4763849443834834e+21
   from  proud pool owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step   no more than the change from city clothes to trunks    157965160593646.62
 nai ve of us    157965160593646.62
 but the results of our impulsive invitations to  come over  next summer and swim in our new pool  were both unexpected and unsettling    3.4960385327193833e+19
    our book of etiquette   after the first few weeks    1195174528897536.8
 it was  obvious that rules had to be made    2.9938895395090994e+21
 laid down and obeyed  even if our  popularity ratings became subnormal as a result    4.186752279592602e+19
 so rules we made    4.186752279592602e+19
  in unabashed collusion    4.186752279592602e+19
 since our viewpoints in this respect coincided  precisely    1.2959741783406977e+19
 we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single  social code for pool owners    1.87834782034091e+22
   first and foremost    1.87834782034091e+22
 no one   no    1.87834782034091e+22
 not anyone  in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations  to his or her own circle    3.2570084700470153e+19
 just short of forty lashes we finally managed  to coerce our children to this view    68969637199205.4
 their friends and ours are  welcome to share the pool    9.828906323909317e+18
 but on our terms and at our times    2.8130846590195483e+19
  no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning  beforehand    1.3570785780905806e+19
   no ringers    1.3570785780905806e+19
 either  even if they are trailing  legitimate invitees    1.5681590579446494e+16
 we want to know when the potlatches telephone  exactly how many they are planning to bring    1.4731246244759514e+16
 so that we won t  end up with a splashing mob that looks like coney island in august    6.649648805902996e+18
  no young children may come without adults except for a specific    7.285054800082258e+17
 chaperoned party    7.285054800082258e+17
 and accompanying adults are urged to  keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities    3.518442860334395e+18
 a gaggle  of gabbling mothers    3.518442860334395e+18
 backs to the pool    3.518442860334395e+18
 is no safeguard    3.518442860334395e+18
   no bottle  pool is tolerated  bottle pool being our lingo for those who come  to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk  and run    4.385048251708676e+17
 solvency and relations with our wine merchant took  a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood  free drink stop    7402103147717448.0
    we designated one day a week as the time  when neighborhood teen agers might swim at definite hours    1.7524342388451178e+19
 this has  saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less  brutal to the young  less fortunate  than ours    1651922164280.7427
   we also  worked out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours  early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco  lunch  en famille     374947959486127.0
 we gently usher them to an island of tables  and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where  they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides    453587144695210.94
   all  dressing  undressing to be more exact  must be done in our small bath  house or at the swimmers  homes    1.670484785961684e+21
  to avoid any possible excuse for  a dripping parade through your house    5.609601156655366e+17
 it is a good idea to have a telephone  extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between  the pool and the parking area    853736.7170288744
  we do    853736.7170288744
 provide a limited  number of extra suits    741521730244984.9
 mainly for children    741521730244984.9

    preserving life and limb   safety rules    2.781865209669726e+21
 of course    2.781865209669726e+21
 are more  important than all the others put together    557017225361454.44
   in many localities    557017225361454.44
 the law requires all pools to be fenced    1.459441633194917e+18
 usually to a minimum  height of 5 feet    9902648924862950.0
 but fenced or unfenced    9902648924862950.0
 no pool side is the place  for running or horseplay    3.1505043995782716e+16
 we allow no underwater endurance contests    4.485897587357022e+19
 or inexpert versions of water polo    227444460742075.94
   diving boards must  have non skid surfaces  coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine  and rots quickly    1638460879738115.8
 but grit impregnated paints are excellent     1.286068346824977e+16
 and  divers must be enjoined to look before they leap    456867513213582.7
 either on top of  someone else or onto a pool edge    2.674672855579485e+19
   our pools also have wide    2.674672855579485e+19
 shallow  steps  for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus  be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords    3.5660438644953952e+19
  all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool  and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups    16421044327521.057
  when you first acquire a pool    1.8526765084964387e+17
 we earnestly recommend  for your  own mental health  a good long chat with your insurance agent    1.435436817086699e+20
 you  should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty  pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits    186497731578.50357
 do not just happen    186497731578.50357
 they are the  result of a constant and careful contest with the elements    4.257118626793059e+22
 unless  you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your  leisure hours nursing your poolpristine purity    3.972436226893367e+18
 its care and  feeding  from  ph content to filtering and vacuuming  is best left  to a weekly or bi monthly professional service    6.266362825557228e+23
 of course    6.266362825557228e+23
 if your  pool is close to the house    1.0882820418152815e+20
 your wife can always add it to her housekeeping  chores  you hope     4.600051364640547e+20
 or you can make pool care the price of swimming  for teen agers    1.0110519926583881e+18
 even so    1.0110519926583881e+18
 every pool owner    1.0110519926583881e+18
 in case of emergency    1.0110519926583881e+18
  should have some idea of what makes things work    2118890830465015.5
 a brief course in  hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future  crisis    2.5945981530350147e+17
    preserving the pool   a sudden high rise in temperature  will turn your pool poison green overnight    1.2137042711816208e+23
 you need more chlorine    1.2137042711816208e+23
 the  walls feel slippery    1.2137042711816208e+23
 you need algaecide    1.2137042711816208e+23
 with or without professional  help    1.2137042711816208e+23
 you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself  unless you have a full time pool nurse    3.0819393435138067e+21
   you should see to it  that the trap    134116751134106.8
 the dirt catcher in front of the filter    1.857563074667933e+17
 is always clean    1.857563074667933e+17
  a pool is no place for a shut trap    2.3761464732381852e+20
   you should firmly insist  that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water    14097276656065.98
 when shed    14097276656065.98
  they leave rust marks    14097276656065.98
   you can hope against hope that come spring  cleaning    8489994594824365.0
 your fair weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing  and furbishing    3.017868127931021e+18
 it has happened    3.017868127931021e+18
   many hours of spring cleaning  will be saved    1.0186908182906676e+16
 if you remove the main drain grate when you  close the pool season in the fall    4189911564840112.5
 as the pool is emptied    4189911564840112.5
 stand by  to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet    2920248548597557.0
 much of  the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp    1.579048268875922e+17
 but requires dynamite  if allowed to dry    4949378060538811.0
 if you have a 6  to 8 inch drain pipe    1.9781086203199674e+17
 you may  easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out    2873620643.310242
 of course    2873620643.310242
 when  your 6 inch torrent of water is released    5.294593152010277e+17
 it may cause a lot of comment  as it passes through or by neighboring properties    2.6945203419609142e+17
 do not forget  this possibility    2.6945203419609142e+17
   if your pool is located on or near sloping  ground    1.0106441386889067e+23
 it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable  than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping  out the water and then scooping out all the debris    334612934345629.56
   it may be  true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene    9452570602940890.0
 but lights also attract  all the insect life for miles around    1.8716171780519286e+17
 once on the water    1.8716171780519286e+17
 these  little visitors seldom leave    1.8716171780519286e+17
 and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming  problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those  present    2.8515343061112476e+19
 often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light  you need at much less expense    1.1594245314749143e+18
   our experience has taught  us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible    3.5708083422655924e+16
 from pipes to  brushes    3.5708083422655924e+16
  follow pool care instructions to the letter    1.0540217413899306e+18
 and be sure that one  person  in the family or not  is regularly responsible for each aspect  of the job    5.525060457262737e+19

  any house built now below that line without air conditioning  will be  obsolete in 10 years     2.332458307358176e+17
 it is the  fha  which has arrived at this conclusion    3005268334892.603
 for it means that cooling equipment  of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage    3.775363114062158e+20
 and thus acquired  with a minimum of financial stress    1.8035016566296522e+21
 even if you live above that line    739918052099740.5
  the  fha will back you    739918052099740.5

 no less an authority  than the  fha concurs that the savings air conditioning makes  possible more than offset its operating costs    2.899331543400425e+18
  is it worth while    2.899331543400425e+18
   home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days  of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted    509191265.49912125
 we know  now that a 15 degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually  desirable    2.5900968999766188e+16
 and accurate controls assure the comfort we want    8.426667786365909e+16
  we know    8.426667786365909e+16
 that health is never harmed by summer cooling    4.159992678960288e+18
 on the  contrary    4.159992678960288e+18

   best of all    546244148803200.4
 central air conditioning  is something you can afford    2.1498699275730977e+19
 like its long lived cousin    2.1498699275730977e+19
  the refrigerator    2.1498699275730977e+19
 a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years  or more    1245473846163691.8
 that brings its per year cost down mighty low    1.7320701572360307e+20
  for any  house    1.7320701572360307e+20
  no matter what style your home is    3.4193498733683946e+22

 colonial  or contemporary    3.4193498733683946e+22
 central air conditioning is easily installed    2.61553314505528e+18
 the  equipment won t take up valuable space either    1494942937722649.5
 it can go in out of the way  waste space    2770260998903182.0
   but thereno denying that the easiest  and most economical way to get year  round whole house air conditioning  is when you build    1.9729235300412457e+19
 if thatdone    1.9729235300412457e+19
 the house can be designed  and oriented for best operation    4.8711358358805696e+17
 and this can mean savings both in the  size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself    3046517.548686698
   if you  can t see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building    1.9022091868535892e+16
  by all means  make provision for its easy adding later     1.0030723123729818e+19
 manufacturers  have designed equipment for just such circumstances    6.03237803802349e+17
 and your  savings over starting from scratch will be substantial    3.7451118635133154e+20
   if your  house is to have a forced warm air system    5.997561970017765e+16
 cooling can be a part of  it    292064715147161.06
 this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system    1.781708168457824e+17
  for your regular heating ductwork    1.781708168457824e+17
 filters and furnace blower do double  duty for cooling    2.7933675670026863e+20
 you can get year  round air conditioners in the  same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone  high or  low boy    2.0114040630614168e+19
 horizontal or counterflow    2.0114040630614168e+19
 the units can be installed in basement    8927474070732905.0
 or in a closet located in the living area    2.7657235594136443e+18
 the  cooling coil is located in the furnaceoutlet    1.0573409296609036e+20
 from the coil  small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set  in the yard    179424569617990.4
 or basement    179424569617990.4
   if you plan to add  cooling later to your heating system    2.256205159481303e+17
 there are things to watch for    995678312513669.1
  be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed    5.512868861053655e+16
  they may be inaccessible later    5.512868861053655e+16
  be sure your ducts and blower are  big enough to handle cooling     2498896998993028.0
 this is especially important if you  live in a mild winter zone    1.2196904013172083e+17
  be sure you get a perimeter heating system     3.7948236618462e+18
  and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for  heating    4.6946503094658136e+16
   you can get a hot water system that will also work  for cooling your house    1.8497605306017413e+18
 for cooling    1.8497605306017413e+18
 chilled water is circulated instead  of hot water    2.0982223699047485e+18
 instead of radiators you ll have cooling heating  units    26614745675.33637
 each with its own thermostat    26614745675.33637
 these systems are more expensive  than year  round forced air systems    4.3123160606497064e+16
 the minimum cost for an average  one story    1.1303603709883548e+19
 7 room house with basement    1.1303603709883548e+19
 is likely to run  1500 above  the cost of the heating alone    806013.0124753843
  separate systems    806013.0124753843
  if the problems  of combining cooling with your heating are knotty    3.800931293134562e+18
 it may be cheaper  to plan on a completely separate cooling system    5.303095894037774e+21
 the simplest kind  of separate system uses a single    6.8917071046364936e+16
 self contained unit    6.8917071046364936e+16
 it is    6.8917071046364936e+16
 in effect    6.8917071046364936e+16
  an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass fiber ducts  to distribute the cooled    3104223097014.5127
 dehumidified air where it is wanted    3104223097014.5127
  in a long    3104223097014.5127
 rambling ranch    3104223097014.5127
 two such units can be installed    2.5718312162411146e+17
  one serving the living area    2.5718312162411146e+17
 the other the sleeping zone    2.5718312162411146e+17
 in a two story  house    2.5718312162411146e+17
 one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first  floor    4441655962.648874
 another in the attic to cool the second    109939290996519.23
 in each case    109939290996519.23
 having  separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of  permitting individual zone control    2158626961465948.0
  the heat pump    2158626961465948.0
  one of the  more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched  to heating    4.218435859433126e+17
 as you know    4.218435859433126e+17
 a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping  the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors    1.9554515287462058e+17
 a relatively  simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine  literally runs backward    6930375772869164.0
 and the heat is extracted from outdoor air  and turned indoors    1.5723590601479916e+18
   up until recently    1.5723590601479916e+18
 this heat pump method  of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when  outside temperatures were above 40 degrees    9.75482792663922e+16
 the machine has been  improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat  at temperatures down to 15 degrees    6316445139995.843
 you can get this added heating  feature for as little as  200 more than the price of cooling alone    2282675974725.277
  consider it as a standby setup    3.121036847900229e+16
 at negligible cost    3.121036847900229e+16
 for those  emergencies when the furnace quits    2952627986987378.5
 a blizzard holds up fuel delivery    1.6439419830103972e+20
  or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don t want to start  up your whole heating plant    2902883279070.304
  what size conditioner    2902883279070.304
  how large  a cooling unit you need    4.281990703242632e+19
 and the method of its installation    81579328938.59491
 depends  on a variety of factors    250630789127421.12
 among other things    250630789127421.12
 besides the nature of  your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from  the outside    6.012012522901018e+20
 it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup  of your family    6535846536123427.0
 families with children usually don t want the house  quite so cool    870497443452725.2
 if you are a party thrower    3.036514024255319e+19
 you may need added capacity    3.036514024255319e+19
  the body is a heat machine    5.728416813344125e+18
 and 20 to 25 guests can easily double  your cooling load    6.854572762279153e+17
   cooling requirements are best expressed in  terms of  btu s    2.5000427488744378e+17
 a  btu is a unit of heat    181908617119651.62
 and the  btu  rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can  pump  out  of your house in an hour    1.6307267871697132e+19
 a very rough rule of thumb is  that    2321990180799642.5
 under favorable conditions    2321990180799642.5
 you ll need 15  btuof cooling  for every square foot of your house    1.3122927959110597e+19
 this is if outdoor temperatures  have a high average of 95 degrees    2.0674442906036467e+17
 you ll need more if the high  average is above that    1.538416533146933e+17
 less if itbelow    1.538416533146933e+17
   coolers are also  rated by tons    4.799731099323625e+16
 a ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by  melting a ton of ice    4.189004109239367e+16
 by accepted definition    4.189004109239367e+16
 a 1 ton conditioner will  provide 12    4.5347400360201917e+18
000  btu of cooling in one hour    5875137985176020.0
   you may find  a conditioner rated by horsepower    8.086633257035094e+16
 it is generally an inaccurate  method of rating    1.8730000255104645e+21
 for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor    7326498405188.441
  and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you ll  get    1.5854706204423073e+18
 a 1  hp conditioner    1.5854706204423073e+18
 for example    1.5854706204423073e+18
 may vary in effectiveness  from under 8    3.1590543273811953e+18

   the  safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit  you need    11955020891967.37
 rather than trying to do this yourself    1.8103463351417876e+16
   don t urge  your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be  sure you have enough    6.993289165972321e+16
 better to have your equipment slightly undersized  than too big    3061628204614812.0
   reducing humidity is often  as important as cooling    7.061362322797614e+18
 an oversize unit will cool off your house quickly    3.7986859184899245e+17
  then shut down for a long period    3.2965545733303173e+18
 before it cycles on again    3.2965545733303173e+18
 humidity  can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature  is still low    3302225702687714.0
 with a unit of the right size    86411108750.9804
 a compressor will  run continuously during hot weather    4853440502900463.0
 reducing humidity as evenly as it  does temperature    1.7006942125272523e+19
  money saving tips    1.7006942125272523e+19
  attention to details can  cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately    1.8566075097082346e+17
  a well designed    1.8566075097082346e+17
 1200 square foot house can be comfortably cooled  and heated for as little as  128 a year    2.4657190979494196e+16
 or  11 a month    2.4657190979494196e+16
  if you have a house which heat doesn t penetrate easily    2682577075.7041483
 your unit  will have less heat to remove    3.539144537121414e+19
 keep the direct sun from reaching the  house and you ve won the first battle    10972511656375.838
 in a new house    10972511656375.838
 generous roof  overhangs are a logical and effective solution    3.3511586543551783e+19
 if the house you plan  to buy or build won t have big overhangs    1.5452659694900188e+18
 you can still do a fair  job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed  trellises    1.7464007172032582e+16
 fences and awnings    1.7464007172032582e+16
   shade trees    1.7464007172032582e+16
 are a big help    1.7464007172032582e+16
  so keep them if you can    6.385832989625966e+17
 drawn blinds and draperies do some good    216657707655919.1
  but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house    70200296544356.46
  the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof    53042749889175.93
 the greater  its heat impact    53042749889175.93
 the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence  how much cooling you re going to need    4.703002532299445e+19
 a shift in the walls    4.703002532299445e+19
  or a change in the roof slope    57320515639876.56
 so the sun hits them more obliquely    1.149884599495099e+16
 can  save you money    1.149884599495099e+16
   you can use heat absorbing glass to stop the  sun    1052048953584474.4
 double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation    3244964762543.3633
  restrict  large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house     13417064235.119625
  they re easier to shade there    3104272710643116.5
 an attic space above insulation makes  a house easier to cool    494060348386525.4
 you ll even gain by putting your water  heater outside the conditioned space    3.0041956033063973e+19
 and using an electric range instead  of a gas one    3.9611976303404736e+17
 gas adds to the moisture load    590854604598.1683
  double glaze to the maximum    590854604598.1683
 in insulation    590854604598.1683
 the numbers to  remember are 6 4 2    1.855270340976916e+16
 they stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation  in the ceiling    23029426234688.97
 4 inches in the side walls    128201529220505.72
 2 inches in the floors    128201529220505.72
  such extra thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling  installation    6.358320469570769e+18
 but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in  heating and cooling    992832205915059.0
 a light colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50  per cent    3.488362914988588e+16
   it costs two to three times as much to remove a  btu  in summer as it does to add one in winter    1.854490557638654e+16
 so every solitary  btu  is worth attention    2.7319310085384096e+16
 you ll foil them in droves    848661040727494.2
 along with  their pal humidity    848661040727494.2

   avoid attic placement directly above  a bedroom    1.9301461935442156e+18
      most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre planning    2.5987303929915448e+20
  this is particularly true in site selection    1.0270344796822274e+21
 you must know before  you start what the needs and objectives of your organtion are    154323343962628.97
 you  must have a list of requirements on where    142814416474372.1
 how many    142814416474372.1
 and what type sites  are needed    8.189995737656571e+16
 with such a program you can make constructive selections  of the best sites available    3260008423.3446665
   begin the examination of a site  with a good map and aerial photos if possible    7174776696984770.0
 these are becoming more  and more available through the work of counties and other government  agencies    1629936498978163.2
 the new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal  government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural  features of the site    1889836372.4750435
 these are inexpensive and available from the u   s  geological society    20244244535.49758
 washington 25    20244244535.49758
 d  c     20244244535.49758
 in recent  years many counties and the u  s  forest service have taken  aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning  use    5.351694205989556e+19
 most counties also have maps available from the county engineer  showing roads and other features and from the assessoroffice  showing ownerships of land    3798902806163.723
   inspect the site in the field during  the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for  recreation    7.319690401523035e+17
 this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the  climate conditions    20756054980.117764
 the exposure to the sun and wind    1479321.8107403633
 the water interests    1479321.8107403633
 which vary greatly with the seasons    418901288758.9706
 it is usually helpful  to make a sketch map in the field    4140907804919.6597
 showing the size and location  of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site    4275616852368.7393
 these  are a great aid for planning use back at the office    3068335288532994.5
     for  site planning work    3068335288532994.5
 it is best to have a qualified and experienced  park planner to carry through the study    53078844928225.14
 there is also much  to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are  available and interested in recreation    3018288409187.6133
 county judges    3018288409187.6133
 and others who have lived in the area for a  long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions  to offer from their varied professional experiences    1.269213874507387e+19
 a visit to the site  by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify  opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area    2007084570218.6628
  how much study is required    2007084570218.6628
 of course    2007084570218.6628
 depends on  the character of the site itself    688135.8994958659
 the previous experience of the investigator    428223921090.6409
  and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision    365181380480973.25
  it is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick  judgment  of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone    1.2878087175691248e+19
 usually  there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions    4.5045052696309816e+18
  a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance  today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little  development or water    1052816446040174.5
 the same is true of areas which at first look  good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually  be poor areas to develop for general public use    2.9125478217978816e+16
   in looking for  the best sites available that meet the requirements    421286012383.611
 you need information  to compare the site with others    1.5760796253118798e+16
 you need answers to four important  questions    2.088009014909507e+18
     what are the existing recreation features    270013236628039.6
    how well can the site be developed    3822450408698.041
     how useful  will it be to the public    2.9815560535549948e+16
     is this site available    2.9815560535549948e+16
  check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests  already existing at the site    34800268380989.473
 a park site with scenic  views    3.6018472438272775e+21
 a good lake    3.6018472438272775e+21
 and sand dunes    3.6018472438272775e+21
 will attract more people  than a nearby area with only trees and dunes    1.6424390237041556e+21
 quality is vitally important    1.6424390237041556e+21
  frontage on a body of clear    1.360208454470607e+17
 clean water will be vastly different  from the same amount of frontage on polluted water    86403751890.83202
 some recreation  features    86403751890.83202
 such as scenic values and water interest    1.121673224331244e+22
 also have greater  overall value than other interests    3.9415662807487604e+20
   one of the most desirable  features for a park are beautiful views or scenery    3.372859651977168e+21
 it may be distant  views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a  small lake    4.3172210343357723e+20
 colorful rock formations    4.3172210343357723e+20
 or unusual trees    4.3172210343357723e+20
 a site which  overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating  traffic    199704548079.16916
 an area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf  rolling in on a beach    1.1397532950235303e+20
 a site may also be attractive just through  the beauty of its trees and shrubs    39823092746042.41
 note extent of these interests and  how available they will be for the public to enjoy    1118219711614.3423
   water interest  is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation  site    3.203457011624066e+20
 most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas    5.932277601733536e+25
  this follows naturally since frontage on an ocean    2.0939335055349812e+20
 or lake  provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation  activities of bathing    8954297143698466.0
 and other water sports    8954297143698466.0
  a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract  the greatest picnic and camping use    4.137416716916492e+19
 it also cools the air in summer  and nourishes the trees and wild life    1544295451842.7214
   the amount of water  frontage    1544295451842.7214
 the quantity and quality of the water    7505404.893426684
 and the recreation  afforded by it are important    1074018075627438.8
 a restricted frontage may be too crowded  an area for public use    2.945188745471392e+19
 the quantity of water flow may be critical    2559336120022885.0
  a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant  or dry in late summer    1.1349358209366928e+16
 if the site is on a reservoir    51692733311228.45
 the level  of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be  studied    1.7810832377888545e+21
 check the quality of the water    31743685357.587643
 a stream which has all of  its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation  practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one  passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area    3531565875518407.5
 other  factors    3531565875518407.5
 such as water temperature    3531565875518407.5
 depth of water    3531565875518407.5
 the fish life it  supports    3531565875518407.5
 wave action    3531565875518407.5
 will affect its recreation  value    3531565875518407.5
     other natural features which can be of high interest  are the forests    446802856529046.94
 sand  dunes    446802856529046.94
 etcetera with which the area is blessed    453548626184.93066
  just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which  are of national or state significance    1.2695552864655434e+18
 counties should seek out these  features which are distinctive of their area    1242602841814542.5
 although the site may  not contain the features themselves    8350974130098.603
 there are often opportunities  to include them as additional interest to the site    1.916061721448069e+20
 the route to the  park may lead people past them or display views of them    2603729294600979.0
 a group of  native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can  be featured at the site    2.7128877745300488e+20
   the fish    2.7128877745300488e+20
 and birds which  may be found at the site are another interest    937610687945.363
 fishing interest calls  for a check of the species found    9.701476405275914e+22
 quantity and size    9.701476405275914e+22
 the season they  are available    9.701476405275914e+22
 and the stocking program of the fish commission    25216859.607666664
 animals  may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas    1923450469818987.2
 the  site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its  own resident bird life    2134195150585000.5
 and other marine life may add  interest at coastal areas    4.394797255762251e+18
     each area has its own historical  interests with which much can be done    1.2023263207826424e+19
 park visitors are always  eager to learn more about the area they are in    303312827172973.7
 the historical sign  tells its story    2.9110221855251993e+19
 but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the  original historical items or places themselves which still have the  character of the period covered    4323601266.617521
 notice should be taken of unusual rock  formations    1.2085799932031072e+16
 or shapes of the earthcrust in your region    22742338547.31847
  those which tell a story of the earthformation in each area  can add geological interest to the recreation sites    1.0890334909016478e+16
 an old shipwreck    1.0890334909016478e+16
  a high dam    1.0890334909016478e+16
 an old covered bridge    1.0890334909016478e+16
 a place to find agates or other  semi precious stones or a place to pan gold    1.2012274810614127e+19
 etcetera may be of interest    1.2012274810614127e+19
  some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient indian  village sites or hunting areas    7.062072697601685e+21
  how well can the site be developed    3822450408698.041
 look at the physical features  of the land to determine how desirable it is for use    5.35323003527771e+18
 what can be done  to correct the faults    53455014995612.836
 and what it will cost to make the area meet your  needs in comparison to other sites    6.521203315960981e+19
 many things need to be checked    2.564893531021365e+16
    size and shape   the size of the area alone can be a determining  factor    9325901563918.35
 an area may be too small for the needs of the project    136566505.56364033
  areas should be large enough to include the attractions    461941217147908.3
 have ample  space for the use of facilities needed    10129893461722.096
 and have room around the edges  to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments    20075386702351.027
  acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation  areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical  to operate one large area than several small ones    4.148404442463788e+17
   shape  of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the  development    6393509.527761159
 a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient  in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width  in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide    3.5811427414218793e+18
 this  is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your  buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions    2.7593309649617504e+21
 a  narrow strip may be very practical for small developments    3.3641135358993297e+19
 or to provide  additional stream frontage for a fishermantrail    1.37892161838174e+19
 or include  scenic strips within the park unit    2.0679685397578912e+17
    adjoining areas   the values  of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands    905984.3394163778
  ownership and use of the land    1195589712902.1558
 and the utilities available there    1195589712902.1558
 for  instance    1195589712902.1558
 a site adjoining other publicly owned lands    2.309565172317763e+18
 such as a national  forest or a public road    2.5897046830173467e+20
 may be desirable    2.5897046830173467e+20
 whereas a site next  to an industrial plant might not    4553155861086105.0
 the utilities available nearby may  provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the  site    201099986195855.94
    topography   topography is very important    201099986195855.94

 the direction    1.478001626663369e+16
 and season of these winds should be noted as to just how  they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation  of the area    3399870481.163595
 lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for  the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable    1129591825456081.2
 you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography  or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade    1.1025533648323352e+17
 morning sun    1.1025533648323352e+17

 i remember  ernest bloch in the foyer    1786195913981.95
 shouting in his high pitched voice    9.962606941517341e+17
     h it may be a  tour de force    9319399870457514.0
 mais mon dieu    9319399870457514.0
  can anyone take  this music seriously     4.176295397677857e+17
   the answer is    4.176295397677857e+17
  america took prokofieff and his  classical  symphony seriously    4.198584596957124e+18
  and with a good deal of pleasure    3.0160212483275026e+19
 his life long friend    3.0160212483275026e+19
 serge  koussevitzky    3.0160212483275026e+19
 gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances  in boston    7.864065804988576e+22
 new york    7.864065804988576e+22
 and washington    7.864065804988576e+22
 d  c     7.864065804988576e+22
 to which  he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation    1.0670494009526673e+19
 chicago was  also a welcome host    7.359119640406314e+19
 in 1921    7.359119640406314e+19
 prokofieff conducted the world  premiere of the  love for three oranges    148880800042.2192
  and played the first  performance of his third piano concerto    89050696996.96944
  uncle sam  was    89050696996.96944
  a rich uncle to prokofieff    89050696996.96944
 in those opulent    89050696996.96944
 post war victory  years of peace and prosperity    9.613587726034835e+16
 bold speculations and extravaganzas    9.613587726034835e+16
 enjoyment  and pleasure    9.613587726034835e+16
  the golden twenties     9.613587726034835e+16
 we attended the  premieres of his concertos    79389357218484.52
 and suites    79389357218484.52
 we studied    79389357218484.52
  and performed his piano sonatas    79389357218484.52
 chamber music    79389357218484.52
 and marches    79389357218484.52
  we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities    6089756545127470.0
  we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as  a world citizen to the first ranks of twentieth century composers    8669137210076.171
 prokofieff was much influenced by paris during  the twenties    1.163114485421012e+17
 the paris which was the artistic center of the western  world  the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrated   the  chic  paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich  america  the  avant garde  paris of diaghileff    1.3805149798708394e+16
 picasso  the  laissez faire  paris of dadaism  and ultramodern art  the paris  sympathique  which took young  composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms    4.213300058958671e+18
  so young prokofieff was the darling of success    107775977405.64922
 in his motherland    107775977405.64922
  in the spacious hunting grounds of  uncle sam     4303048747188.9014
 in the exciting  salons of his lovely    28022466324056.78
 brilliant paris  mistress of gaiety   excess and abandon  world theatre of new found freedoms in tone    4.665534397006749e+18
 and thought    4.665534397006749e+18
 three great terrible  forces were coagulating and crystallizing    1.7230326736255367e+19
 in this world wide conscription  of men    122910470081131.89
 and machines    122910470081131.89
 prokofieff was recalled to his  native land    3.542639019554644e+17
 the world exploded when fascism challenged all concepts  of peace and liberty    4067020903821179.5
 and the outraged    4067020903821179.5
 freedom loving peoples of the  capitalist and socialist worlds combined forces to stamp fascist  tyranny into cringing submission    1.0069435910263865e+19
 after this holocaust    1.0069435910263865e+19
 a changing world  occupied the minds of men    319629367433193.94
 a world beset with new boundaries    1.0926428567673799e+19
 new  treaties and governments    1.0926428567673799e+19
 new goals and methods    1.0926428567673799e+19
 and the age old fears  of aggression  and subjugation  hunger and exposure    3.525430626313828e+20
   in this  changed world    3.525430626313828e+20
 prokofieff settled to find himself    3.525430626313828e+20
 and to create  for  large national purpose    6.222846728137435e+17
 this happy    6.222846728137435e+17
 roving son of good fortune  proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social economic  order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world    9.617668649421778e+21
 prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of socialism   producing music for the masses    1.7780123299346096e+23
   it is at this point in his life  that the mature prokofieff emerges    519312904284714.3
 one might have expected that  such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative  flair of a composer    4855406948697985.0
 especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous    1.9522051225773335e+22
  but no    1.9522051225773335e+22
 he accepted the environment  of his destiny  took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his  early promise    1714638027082.732
 by 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his  people    3.3480035404415773e+21
  i have striven for clarity and melodious idiom    4268038184696600.5
 but at  the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the  accepted methods of harmony and melody    179344125198000.22
 this is precisely what makes  lucid    1.264435364816485e+17
 straightforward music so difficult to compose  the clarity must  be new    7.149881938617791e+19
 not old     7.149881938617791e+19
 how right he was    7.149881938617791e+19
 how clearly he saw the cultural  defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not  or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism    12829028398.737839
 and  with what resource did prokofieff back up his credo of words  with  torrents of powerful music    3.69528668808268e+19
 compare the vast difference in scope and  beauty between his neat and witty little  classical  symphony and  his big    4.646155865531841e+19
 and eloquent fifth symphony    4.646155865531841e+19
 or the   love for three oranges   gay as it is  with the wonderful    3.3736229161929875e+17
 and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet    2842167327069.327
   the stone flower     2842167327069.327
 this masterpiece has gaiety    2842167327069.327
 but it is  the gaiety of dancing people    410094486657663.56
 salty and humorous    410094486657663.56
   of  course    410094486657663.56
 these works are not comparable    410094486657663.56
 even though the same brain conceived  them    6.977782951019958e+16
 the early works were conceived for a sophisticated    2.1514815388571333e+19
 international  audience    2.1514815388571333e+19
 the later works were conceived to affirm a way  of life for fellow citizens    2.6189035913025524e+16
 in all of prokofieffmusic    2.6189035913025524e+16
  young or mature    2.6189035913025524e+16
 we find his profile  his  signature   his  craftsmanattitude    4.731805343778338e+23
 prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the  cause of experimentation  per se     2.565246895197739e+16
 in orchestration    2.565246895197739e+16
 he stretches  the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination  for color    2.949564247532921e+22
 his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable    1.0924200223371745e+21
  his creative development of melodic designs of slavic dance tunes and  love songs is captivating    74864874198.74982
 and subtle    74864874198.74982
 his  counterpoint is pertinent    74864874198.74982
 and rarely thick    74864874198.74982
  it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic  modulations    25304511179703.895
 the brilliant orchestrations    25304511179703.895
 the adroitness for evading  the heaviness of figured bass    54387414295.90056
 the skill in florid counterpoint  were not lost in his mature output    2.0456307129229926e+18
 even in the spectacular historical  dramas of the stage and cinema    301751211.7276594
 where a large    301751211.7276594
 dramatic canvas of sound  was required    1.3739752693660495e+18
 that prokofieffharmonies and forms sometimes  seem professionally routine to our ears    2.4065275501344756e+21
 may or may not indicate that  he was less of an  original  than we prefer to believe    399279897857775.3
 need for  novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability    3.154250675531036e+19
  prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero    1.8065741625375214e+18
 by the force of  his creative life    870878348732.0498
 helped preserve the main stream of tradition    246073418911013.78
 to which  the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually  added and integrated    6.276460109917992e+17
   at this date    6.276460109917992e+17
 it seems probable that the  name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archives of history    10278662010367.584
  as an effective traditionalist    10278662010367.584
 who was fully aware of the lure and danger  of experimentation    6080203448051.298
 and used it as it served his purpose    3.85671457726289e+17
 yet  was never caught up in it  never a slave to its academic dialectics    1.852737253972334e+17
 it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared  him to the western world  not his experimentations    8256349434.228587
   so  prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a  rich reward from them    6.430471712773807e+18
 nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would  have done better    2.4285789740149424e+17
 or even as well    2.4285789740149424e+17
 under different circumstances    2.4285789740149424e+17
  his fellow countryman    2.4285789740149424e+17
 igor stravinsky    2.4285789740149424e+17
 certainly did not    2.4285789740149424e+17
 why did  prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity    193811743900226.75
 while stravinsky  who leaped  into fame like a young giant  dwindled in stature and fruitfulness    3.3258872811014402e+19
  i think the answer is to be found in prokofieffown words    2551397255662023.0
   the clarity must be new    2551397255662023.0
 not old     2551397255662023.0
 when prokofieff forged his  new clarity of  lucid    51734982248829.086
 straightforward music    51734982248829.086
 so difficult to compose     51734982248829.086
  he shaped his talents to his purpose    1.2582763316643163e+21
   when stravinsky  shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures    569704326633.2086
 many salons    569704326633.2086
  many dialectics    569704326633.2086
 many personalities    569704326633.2086
 he tried to refashion himself  into a stylist of many styles    4303421326490750.5
 determined by many disparate cultures    4303421326490750.5
  prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own  people  by the compass of their national ideas    2.348227042523304e+17
 but stravinsky  was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting    2987823200428457.5
 in  all his miscalculations    2987823200428457.5
 stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder  of presuming that he could transform other composers  inspirations   representing many peoples    3.216027291229107e+19
 time periods and styles  into his own  music by warping the harmony    1.710695631381698e+21
 or form    1.710695631381698e+21
 to verify his own experiments    1.710695631381698e+21
  because of the authentic homogeneity of his early nationalistic  materials    1601362217.5717027
 and his flair for orchestrations  his brilliant  petruchka    1.8365433013672257e+20
   his savage  sacre du printemps    1.8365433013672257e+20
  his incisive  les noces    the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical  direction for which his native talents were predisposed    3.114864542505498e+20
   but  time is running out    3.114864542505498e+20
 and many of stravinskyadmirers begin to fear  that he will never find  terra firma     4.617836330226237e+16
 his various aesthetic postulates  remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself    1.03049140739137e+19
 supra expressionism    1.03049140739137e+19

  post serialism  all competing with each other within one composer    7278351308420849.0
  what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations    711208700762188.2
 meager  and shabby by products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty  protagonist    77990183154724.6
  a maladroit reharmonization of our national anthem   the  star spangled banner      1.5004522969280564e+20
 a poor attempt to write an idiomatic  jazz concerto    9.678547424652515e+17
 a circus polka for elephants    9.678547424652515e+17
 his hopes that the tunes  from his old music might be used for popular american commercial  songs    6.262861568431255e+16
 nearing the age of eighty    6.262861568431255e+16
 is like a lost and frantic  bird    7584784475692012.0
 flitting from one abandoned nest to another    1270049031705144.8
 searching for  a home    1270049031705144.8
   how differently prokofiefflife unfolded    1270049031705144.8
 prokofieff  was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing  world without losing his particular force and direction    1.080597108937482e+20
 in the process    1.080597108937482e+20
  his native endowments were stretched    1.080597108937482e+20
 strengthened and disciplined  to serve their human purpose    4964040029216849.0
   with a large and circumspect  20th century technique    7.733356719902802e+17
 he wove the materials of national heroes and  events    9218995902.654148
 national folklore and childrenfairy tales  slavic dances  and love songs  into a solid musical literature which served his  people well    1.929513490276684e+23
 and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large    9.088525707603682e+20
  of course    9.088525707603682e+20
 it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical  feat    3.855343039277412e+18
 prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind  him    410083025800.87555
 time and economic security    410083025800.87555
 symphony orchestras    410083025800.87555
 opera and ballet  companies    410083025800.87555
 chamber music ensembles    410083025800.87555
 large and eager audiences    410083025800.87555
 it  must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many  of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive    28130643271.622746
 economic  security and cultural opportunities    28130643271.622746
 incisive idioms    28130643271.622746
 social fermentations  for a new national ideology  a sympathetic public and a large  body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose    6365706976934207.0
   thus  in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republics produced  one of the great composers of the twentieth century    6846369.155858385
 that his moods    6846369.155858385
  even in his early years    6846369.155858385
 are those of his people    6846369.155858385
 does him honor    6846369.155858385
  as his music honors those who inspired it    4.595878169659547e+23
 that he mastered every aspect  of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary  judgments    1.2459211697378556e+20
 is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous  pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture    77206601551912.61
  and perhaps of even greater significance  his music is strong 20th century  evidence of the effectiveness of evolution    2945096017.262376

 took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions    9.943590639466155e+21
 and imparted  to them his knowledge and love of nature    2.1711925307856028e+20
 out of this background of  hunting and fishing    1766589715633.1108
 it was only natural that roy first painted subjects  he knew best    8.012468616667585e+17
 hunters in the field    8.012468616667585e+17
 fishermen in the stream    8.012468616667585e+17
 ducks  and geese on the wing  almost always against a vast backdrop of  weather landscape    1.1544816945157816e+21
 it is this subject matter that has brought mason  a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen    1.7929180444362858e+22
 but it is his exceptional  performance with this motif that commends him to artists and  discerning collectors    1.7467235270331296e+16
   mason had to earn the privilege of devoting  himself exclusively to painting    21401639591409.176
 like many others    21401639591409.176
 he had to work  hard    21401639591409.176
 long hours in a struggling family business which    3.453460458422369e+18
 though it was  allied to art of a kind  the design and production of engraved seals   bore no relation to the painting of pictures    474579820673551.75
 but it did teach  roy the basic techniques of commercial art    5.376540207977437e+16
 and later    5.376540207977437e+16
 for twelve years    5.376540207977437e+16
  he and his sister nina conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia    8.786872124511235e+21
  on the death of their father    1675781056935.0266
 they returned to their home  in batavia    3.1934713741040412e+16
 new york    3.1934713741040412e+16
 after more years of concentrated effort    6.332628415324185e+16
 roy  and his brother max finally established a thriving family business  at the old stand    3.878556481979989e+17
   during all this time roy continued to paint    1.9434223788228536e+16
  first only on weekends    1.9434223788228536e+16
 and then    1.9434223788228536e+16
 as the family business permitted    1.9434223788228536e+16
  for longer periods    1.9434223788228536e+16
 gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether    157532483006935.4
  and for the past thirty years    129876446727159.38
 he has worked independently as a painter    3455111413971738.0
  except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions    1.4631040744930632e+19
 but even  on these    1.4631040744930632e+19
 the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off    7.56424827234979e+16
  except for a rich friendship with the painter    1.2096582942194342e+20
 chauncey ryder  who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had  and  this was limited to a few lessons    2.9120362217784704e+18
 though the two artists often went on  painting trips together  roy developed his art by himself    8.217639316618994e+18
 in the  best tradition    8.217639316618994e+18
 he first taught himself to see    72679700028300.86
 then to draw with accuracy  and assurance    3607322035923.791
 and then to paint    3607322035923.791
 he worked in oil for years before  beginning his work in watercolor    1.5705451067877375e+21
 and his first public recognition  and early honors    6.604019564068872e+22
 including his election to the academy    2377611262034335.0
 were for  his essays in the heavier medium    2.0917224264291528e+18
 gradually watercolor claimed his greater  affection until today it has become his major    1.0009350551844164e+18
 if not exclusive    1.0009350551844164e+18
   it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason  on numerous occasions    1114091009031507.1
 mostly in the vicinity of batavia    1.0118471474730115e+17
 more often  than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at  a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature  into a composed    5.081642297646486e+18
 not imitative    5.081642297646486e+18
 what i have observed  time and time again is a process of integration    1.5895286850470134e+20
 integration that begins  as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form    2.7070630155966566e+19
 color  patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition    3996974891223962.0
  and that over all    3996974891223962.0
 amazing control of large washes which is the mason  stylemark    1082899629275375.1
 finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the  job is done    22508392490396.85
 inspiring  yes    22508392490396.85
 instructive  maybe    22508392490396.85
   but for the technical fact    22508392490396.85
 we have the artist own testimony    9390626296417950.0
    of late years    9390626296417950.0
 i find that i like best to  work out of doors    6978469676723608.0
 first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in  quarter scale  approximately   f inches  in which i pay particular attention  to the design principles of three simple values  the lightest  light    2.343931824736792e+17
 the middle tone    2.343931824736792e+17
 and the darkest dark  by reducing the forms  of my subject to these large patterns    2.3233256047600947e+18
 if a human figure or wild life  are to be part of the projected final picture    9042280080.955034
 i try to place them  in the initial sketch    75124033164286.12
 for me    75124033164286.12
 these will belong more completely to  their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage    5.280640697974295e+16
 though  i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on  the full sheet when it serves my final purpose    8.955054999807552e+20
    i am thoroughly  convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects  nature will do his composing for him    6.623266877054557e+20
 as a result    6.623266877054557e+20
 such pictures are  only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before  him    10658405681091.271
 just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot  is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting    7216545303210.12
  unless the position serves the design of the whole composition    46104285952186.16
  if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain  units in his design    2.7972961617614864e+19
 often only slightly    2.7972961617614864e+19
 finer pictures would result    2.7972961617614864e+19
  out of long experience i have found that incidental figures and other  objects like trees    2.6195446467016694e+18
 and bushes can be traced from the original  sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they  occupy the right position    908707701192029.5
 which i call  clicking     908707701192029.5
    speed  in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity  and crispness    5.38212560895455e+17
 but unless the artist has lots of experience so that  he can control rapid execution    2634727515049320.5
 he would do well to take these first sketches  and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition    305258541787526.94
   if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition    230719955814.2372
  i mean to project equal concern for color    4.0226743312294726e+17
 in working  out of doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere    664799402806928.2
 a particular  passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be  too bright    51419728273168.68
 too dull    51419728273168.68
 or too light    51419728273168.68
 or too dark when viewed indoors in  a mat    1.1620393286959936e+20
 when this occurs    1.1620393286959936e+20
 i make the change on the sketch or on the  final watercolor  if i have been working on a full sheet in the field    6.191561525084902e+20
   when working from one of my sketches i square it up and  project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal    408475374615.7503
  when this linear draft is completed    1.0404400719810288e+20
 i dust it down to a faint  image    6159781232309456.0
 from this point    6159781232309456.0
 i paint in as direct a manner as possible    1.7004533629920102e+17
 by  flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as i can manage    1.3279379552347444e+21
 first  i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and  design along the lines i have described    7674728329073639.0
 then i plan my attack    7674728329073639.0
  the parts i will finish first    1.1987720923982392e+16
 the range of values    1.1987720923982392e+16
 the accenting of  minor details  all in all    1.469484819122043e+16
 mechanics of producing the finished job  with a maximum of crispness    6.966221684977502e+18
 the longer i work    6.966221684977502e+18
 the more i am sure  that for me    1.9272823332550988e+16
 at least    1.9272823332550988e+16
 a workmanlike method is important    1.9272823332550988e+16
 trial and  error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles  in the final painting    6.866710260253882e+18
    as for materials    6.866710260253882e+18
 i use the  best available    6.866710260253882e+18
 i work on a watercolor easel in the field    1.0179687791972977e+19
 and frequently  resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue  strain    3.9091715917942856e+21
 in my studio i work at a tilt top table    5.97273993661328e+20
 but leave the paper  unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the washes    115806439114533.06
 i have  used a variety of heavy weight hand made papers    1.9069074892699006e+20
 but prefer an english  make    1.9069074892699006e+20
 rough surface    1.9069074892699006e+20
 in 400 pound weight    1.9069074892699006e+20
 after selecting a sheet  and inspecting it for flaws  even the best sometimes has foreign  nubbins   on its surface     2.8041714718121374e+19
 i sponge it thoroughly on both sides with  clean    2.1108387975861776e+16
 cold water    2.1108387975861776e+16
 then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that  it will lie flat as a board    3.3792408370740945e+19
    in addition to the usual tools    3.5327329126127736e+16
  i make constant use of cleansing tissue    3.395761518697026e+17
 not only to wipe my brushes    1.2615612851187174e+18
  but to mop up certain areas    1871929534752604.8
 to soften edges    1871929534752604.8
 and to open up lights  in dark washes    1.414350680747826e+18
 the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that  it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the  watercolorist    1190066556337996.5
 i also use a small electric hand blower to dry large  washes in the studio    6.099591269484269e+19
   my brushes are different from those used  by most watercolorists    6.578574840321574e+20
 for i combine the sable and the bristle    1.210476347636196e+16
 the  red sables are  8    1.210476347636196e+16
 two riggers    1.210476347636196e+16
  6 and  10    1.210476347636196e+16
 and a very large    1.210476347636196e+16
  flat wash brush    1.210476347636196e+16
 the bristles are a fitch  2 and a one half  inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge    2.6015007469297568e+17
    my usual palette  consists of top quality colors    2.187358978496215e+17
 alizarin crimson    2.187358978496215e+17
 raw sienna    2.187358978496215e+17
  raw umber    2.187358978496215e+17
 burnt sienna    2.187358978496215e+17
 cerulean blue    2.187358978496215e+17
 cobalt blue    2.187358978496215e+17
 french  ultramarine blue    2.187358978496215e+17
 winsor green    2.187358978496215e+17
 cadmium yellow  pale    2.187358978496215e+17
 yellow ochre    2.187358978496215e+17
 charcoal gray    2.187358978496215e+17
  and ivory black     2.187358978496215e+17
   in analyzing the watercolors of roy mason    8625615485927329.0
  the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness    1.6936210058012412e+24
  yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration  here    7.522533665623907e+16
 a mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis  of nature rather than a detailed inventory    1.2975047808037282e+19
 unlike many decorative patterns  that present a static flat convention    4.922235246637365e+18
 this artistpictures  are full of atmosphere and climate    79162614304469.36
   long observation has taught  mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes    1.920423098863607e+16
  a foreground in sharp focus  either a light area with dark accents  or a dark one with lights    5.127001038854044e+19
 a middle distance often containing the  major motif    4.878978429148868e+22
 and a background    4.878978429148868e+22
 usually a silhouetted form foiled against  the sky    7.463523923163845e+16
 in following this general principle    7.463523923163845e+16
 mason provides the  observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background    2.404423284684232e+23
  and the illusion of depth is instantly created    981549030273.9083
   when painting    981549030273.9083
  masonphysical eyes are half closed    981549030273.9083
 while his mindeye  is wide open    981549030273.9083
 and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression  he wishes to convey    732435542125485.2
 he does not insist on telling all he knows about  any given subject    6.311903751843416e+18
 rather his pictures invite the observer to draw  on his memory    1.638490208690784e+19
 his imagination    1.638490208690784e+19
 his nostalgia    1.638490208690784e+19
 it is for this  reason that roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition  of place for their enjoyment    1136186455188320.2
 his pictures generalize    1136186455188320.2
 though  they are inspired by a particular locale    1.8681649094098215e+19
 they universalize in terms  of weather    299133805785929.5
 and people    299133805785929.5
 by dealing with common landscape  in an uncommon way    1.1849689027582007e+19
 roy mason has found a particular niche in american  landscape art    3.572298559856881e+16
 living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience  of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor    106186929972.20102
  a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor  the creator of it all    3089477590633974.5
   the artist was born in gilbert mills    7.028157220284803e+18
  new york    7.028157220284803e+18
 in 1886    7.028157220284803e+18
 and until two years ago when he and his wife moved  to california    4.4887452198717915e+19
 he lived in western new york    275794381568992.97
 in batavia    275794381568992.97
 when  i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march  15th    5814782375912085.0
 i realized that roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for  a watercolorist    1739040696271.6594
 the water sign of pisces  february 18 march 20     296068048892151.44
  and how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes    8.306450619340026e+20
 and  how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again    4.3621230339821146e+17
  in his natal month of march    2559004468868918.0
   over the years    2559004468868918.0
 beginning in  1929    2559004468868918.0
 mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold  medals    9.95681179452117e+20

 the  300 prize for a watercolor at  the laguna beach art association    1.667621455769457e+16
   he was elected to the national  academy of design as an associate in the oil class in 1931   after receiving his first ranger fund purchase prize at the academy  in 1930     1.4761100956596573e+17
 and elevated to academicianship in 1940    1.4761100956596573e+17

 the russians  are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics    200336242800543.44
  but why gymnastics at all    200336242800543.44
 and is the sport really important    2694104554860052.5
  after all    2694104554860052.5
 we did pretty well in some other areas of the olympics  competition    8987069703354.322
 but if it is important    8987069703354.322
 what can we do to improve ourselves    57737858189232.11
  it is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem    6.95402079486525e+16
  for just as gymnastics can learn from dance    3.4971786796240963e+18
 dance has some very  important things to learn from gymnastics    1.2001536456115033e+21
   taking first things  first    1.2001536456115033e+21
 letunderstand the sport called gymnastics    1.2001536456115033e+21
 it is made up  of tumbling    2.6010206545195578e+17
 which might be said to start with a somersault    2900634897334927.5
 run through  such stunts as headstands    5.392687551228152e+20
 and  culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists    h and apparatus work    3.587197419715774e+16
 the apparatus used by gymnasts was once a  common sight in american gyms    1.7765637627413355e+20
 but about 1930 it was dropped in favor  of games    1.7078741294465122e+20
 the parallel bars    1.7078741294465122e+20
 horizontal bar    1.7078741294465122e+20
 and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball    2.9671600644196814e+20
 basketball and football    2.9671600644196814e+20
   but the russians use  gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because  it provides training in every basic quality except one    9.984502247154939e+19
 the  gymnast must develop strength    9.984502247154939e+19
 persistence and the desire for perfection    4.205244627578537e+16
  in short    4.205244627578537e+16
 gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great  deal of character as well    3.3740991316094024e+18
 the addition of endurance training later    7.212844563754431e+17
  when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury    1758348792194349.2
  provides that final quality that makes the top athlete    1.5275472340238976e+18
 soldier  or citizen    1.5275472340238976e+18
   another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that  it can be started very early in life    9.045260889941706e+17
  an enterprising teacher or parent   could  start training a healthy child at the age of seven days    10948121591205.012
  most europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries    4.311181038593681e+19
   in most sports    4.311181038593681e+19
 as in most walks of life    2.342589282585558e+16
 the angels are on the side  of those who begin young    1203066884888402.5
 and the russian competitor of 16 has at  least thirteen years of training behind him    1.1268698927250034e+16
 the american is very lucky  if he has three    9.833882853201434e+16
   if a nation wished to get a head start in  physical fitness over all other nations    6.610710118715122e+19
 it would start its kindergarten  students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus  eliminate a large number of the problems that plague american schools    157555375786.21237
  first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension    9.993578752281455e+22
  since action relieves both    9.993578752281455e+22
 oddly enough    9.993578752281455e+22
 it is proven that there  would be less reading difficulty    2.028695670719806e+16
 certainly there would be less anxiety    3.699855623337739e+18
  fewer accidents  it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries     4.507190271750606e+20
  and higher scholastic averages    4.507190271750606e+20
 since alert children work better    4.507190271750606e+20
  russia knows this    4.507190271750606e+20
 and that is why there were over 800    6.169457729152948e+18
000 competing  for places as candidates for the olympic gymnastic team    6.576382697598326e+17
 eighty  thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself    6799170837250844.0
 we  could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people    4.839675767959262e+21
  and what has dancing to do with all this    2.5634893727091744e+16
 a great deal    2.5634893727091744e+16
  russiayoung gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous  training on apparatus    3.569493411234652e+17
 well stretched    3.569493411234652e+17
 trained in posture and coordinated  movement    1.219156594945501e+20
 and wedded to rhythm    1.219156594945501e+20
 they presented the audiences  in  rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any olympic  contest    3.8818437275106963e+17
 american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons    1.7972775809741722e+18
  they saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing  with incredible grace    3.937891085652238e+20
 they were further stripped of old wive tales  by seeing the slender    1.1777261617946616e+18
 lovely russian girls performing feats requiring  tremendous strength   h and with not one bulging muscle    1.653600196752391e+20
   president  kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation    2.5443508320487126e+17
 if  we wait until children are in junior high or high school    5.448423597036363e+17
 we will never  manage it    5.448423597036363e+17
 to be fit    5.448423597036363e+17
 one has to start early with young children    9845293226368232.0
  and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher  of dance    1.6106715290115203e+19
 if the dance teachers of america make it their business  to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come  some day if our schools are really responsible    4.5468517722146007e+20
 we will be that much  ahead    8.155959169040486e+16
 school teachers    8.155959169040486e+16
 all too unprepared for the job they must do    9102603329176.555
  will need demonstrators    9102603329176.555
 there should be youngsters who know how to do  a headstand    6150607430431441.0
 and also how to help other children learn it    152609066734678.38
 they should  know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for  the sports we will demand be taught    14894571336310.629
   dance teachers can respond  to president kennedyrequest not only through their regular  dance work    2.328644334643475e+18
 but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes  for strength and flexibility    7.625812612011858e+21
   very little in todayliving  provides the strength we need   h and nothing provides the flexibility    2.4089184763568614e+18
  dancers do have flexibility    2.4089184763568614e+18
 they often fail    2.4089184763568614e+18
 to develop  real abdominal    2.4089184763568614e+18
 shoulder and arm strength    2.4089184763568614e+18
 ask any group  of ballerinas to do ten push ups or three chin ups and the results    1.0734009934436045e+18
  considering the amount of physical training they have had    5.304966675784383e+16
 will be  very disappointing    5.304966675784383e+16
 even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas    698567193052763.8
  this isn t surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of  the 11 year old boys in america  cannot chin themselves once     2.605766058314768e+19
 and  that english school girls outdo them in almost every test  even dashes  and endurance     1617799426373692.0
 the only area in which american boys hold their own  is the baseball throw    6.8898356879723264e+22
    the chinning bar   for arm and shoulder  strength a chinning bar is recommended    1.9530217174764896e+24
 it should be installed over  a door that is in full view of everyone    5.841808481555969e+20
 and a chair should be placed  under it    2.7581442837072488e+20
 a little to one side    2.7581442837072488e+20
 those children who can chin themselves  should be told to do  one  chin up each time they pass under it    1.8631610089239852e+22
  those who are too weak    1.8631610089239852e+22
 should climb on the chair and    123455008783763.55
 starting at the  top of the chin    935777.6681753627
 let themselves  slowly  down    935777.6681753627
 when they can take  ten seconds to accomplish the descent    7.453823999668073e+18
 they will have the strength to  chin  up     11884870505726.11
 parents should be informed about this system and encouraged  to do the same with the whole family at home    357405770815.694
    the horse kick    arm    357405770815.694
 upper and lower back strength will be aided with  the horse kick    40530760775110.125
 start on hands and feet    40530760775110.125
 keeping the hands in  the starting position    3.29715988173489e+16
 run in place to a quick rhythm    6.74596320744363e+17
 after this has  become easy    6.74596320744363e+17
 use slower and slower rhythms    6.74596320744363e+17
 kicking higher and higher    6.74596320744363e+17
  follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on  all fours    77770454133295.27
 kicking as high as possible    77770454133295.27
    push ups   push ups are  essential    4.141380654684135e+21
 but few have the strength for them at first    1.8004729592462368e+17
 start on the  knees in a large circle    2332003154404.4116
 fall slowly forward onto the hands and let  the body down to rest on the floor    1131290968716.938
 push back up and repeat    1131290968716.938
 do this  exercise six times each class period    6.2439199572890124e+19
 as strength improves start in  a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward    1.0740947758327846e+20
  start by falling forward to a point close to the feet    894315836230.4198
 as strength  improves    894315836230.4198
 fall farther and farther out    894315836230.4198
 try to push back to the stand  position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes  from the hands    3.6848933902442426e+19
 the push up itself can be taught by starting at the   top  of the push up with legs spread wide    5764128137.624513
 let the body down slowly    5764128137.624513
  taking at least five seconds for the letting  down     8.689774781377166e+16
 five of these  done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push  up     3.645302721683939e+20
    handstands   handstands come after arms    3.645302721683939e+20
 chest and shoulders  have developed at least a minimum of strength    147951524426595.03
 of course those  who have developed more will find them easier    7.094109715158904e+16
 start with the class  standing in a circle    3410603977675540.5
 with weight on the right foot and the left extended  a little way into the circle    6821496541842659.0
 at first each child should do a kick  up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work  alone    474847931246427.2
 and those who need help    474847931246427.2
 drop both hands to the floor and at the  same time kick the right foot up in back    1.5147227593348954e+16
 the left will follow at  once    1.7237058033631852e+18
 the right will land first    1.7237058033631852e+18
 followed by the left    1.7237058033631852e+18
 return to the  standing position    1.7237058033631852e+18
 care should be taken to see that the hands are placed  on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot  is brought as close to the hands as possible    91976426941.40239
 this will prevent flat  falls and toe injuries    4498408274544448.0
 bare feet are better for such work than any  form of slipper    4911269954255492.0
 eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough  so that the teacher can catch the leading leg    6730127922113639.0
 the child should  then bring both legs together overhead    7.69067217355241e+19
 point the toes and tighten the  seat muscles    5433333369600037.0
 be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the  hands and that only one foot lands at a time    1.0804007803260848e+21
    backbends   the backbend  is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics    95769074378937.45
  as with all acrobatics    95769074378937.45
 the sooner begun the better the results    7008174166843373.0
 have  the class lie supine with knees apart and bent    597776077718168.2
 place flat palms on  either side of the head a few inches away from the ears    695501446875868.5
  fingers pointing  toward the shoulders     695501446875868.5
 arch the back upwards to make a bridge    614185338681.0078
  be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor  rather than toward the ceiling    3369660477950282.0
 as flexibility improves    3369660477950282.0
 the feet will  move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher    503272818998.5212
 later this can  be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover    57284788023187.09
    back circle    to further increase back flexibility    4.721623817895591e+20
 work on the back circle    4.721623817895591e+20
 have  the class lie prone    4.721623817895591e+20
 place the hands in front of the chest    517822989266.8711
 keep  the legs straight and the toes pointed    384440034.80448234
 straighten the arms slowly    384440034.80448234
  this arches the back    384440034.80448234
 at the peak of the arch    860287175003.2368
 tip the head back and  bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head    1.1868813443050077e+20
 improvement can be  measured by the lessening distance between toes and head    1.2804726403562568e+17
    somersaults    the last essential to the beginnergymnastic program is the  somersault    1719922627393334.2
 or forward roll    1719922627393334.2
 this used to be part of every child bag of tricks    1491289443521751.5
 but few children can do it today    4.4376637777577554e+18
 some are actually  incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting  or standing upright    4.2850356148270176e+17
 for most small children    4.2850356148270176e+17
 learning a forward  roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can    4.588014075346139e+17
 after it has  been seen    4.588014075346139e+17
 have the child start on a mat on hands and knees  a thin    9.312987529394562e+21
  inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require  falling     1.835388670309567e+17
 he places the hands on either side of the head    6639436667503026.0
 keeping  the chin down on the chest    1.0470958675381051e+18
 he then pushes his seat into the air and  the teacher guides it over    269285272.60311395
 one or two practice runs should be sufficient  for solo    1.6914475970243354e+21
 the child is weak    1.6914475970243354e+21
 or afraid    1.6914475970243354e+21
  more help will be needed    1.6914475970243354e+21
 when the child raises his seat into the air    1.881932542411426e+18
  the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis    2.703386368601679e+19
 then no matter  what happens    2.703386368601679e+19
 the childperformance will be controlled    2.703386368601679e+19
 by lifting  the seat upwards a little    114639158534232.44
 the weight is taken off the neck and  the back is kept rounded    23768743277829.133
   these are beginnings    23768743277829.133
 but correctly  learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed  by a strong    9.354129679012991e+17
 flexible body  we are not talking of eccentric extremes     5.262302651829982e+18
  even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal    163330136779882.94
 the good tumbler  will be a better dancer    4.563315789681982e+17
 a better athlete    4.563315789681982e+17
 and a human being with  a greater margin of safety in any activity    2.598807862752619e+16
   it is very important  for parents to understand that early training is imperative    2326827141956439.5
 and dancing  school    2326827141956439.5
 so helpful in artistic and psychological development    2.909090210077128e+18
 also  contributes to this essential early training  and can contribute  even more    1.372593478410359e+19
  every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual  defense  budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion  of these expenditures go for military electronics    1.633436737919977e+21
 we have noted how  some electronic techniques    4.6409091721379014e+20
 developed for the defense effort    4.6409091721379014e+20
 have evenutally  been used in commerce and industry    2.3413364266324102e+17
 the host of novel applications  of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because  of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality    1.732416801620142e+21
  when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment    2.98711232217384e+20
  the prospect is staggering    2.98711232217384e+20
 the author has recently studied  the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that    405365892194401.7
 in this  area alone    405365892194401.7
 the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities    2773383196931030.5
  the benefits electronics can bring to bio medicine may be  greater by far than any previous medical discovery    8.094922726782971e+17
 we use the term   bio medicine  because of the close interrelation between biology  and medical research    109245217070400.83
   electronics has been applied to medicine  for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x ray machine    282991202476.74567
  the electrocardiograph    282991202476.74567
 and the diathermy machine    282991202476.74567
 recently many  doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage  of bruises    1.1968858518829298e+24
 and simple bursitis    1.1968858518829298e+24
   commonly used electronic  devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed circuit   tv and audio systems for internal paging and instruction    1.496383932939579e+22
  along with radiation counters    1.496383932939579e+22
 and similar devices    1.496383932939579e+22
  in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application  of electronics in bio medical research laboratories because this  is where tomorrowcommonplace equipment originates    7.317845091528025e+20
 from the wealth  of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques  perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which  appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely  new tools in medical research    2.302700823030658e+19
    ultraviolet microscopy    many cells    2.302700823030658e+19
 and other microorganisms are transparent to visible  light and must be stained for microscopic investigation    1332547485580159.5
 this stain  often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside    1.4530119742448982e+20
  a completely new insight into living cells and their structure  will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light  with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color  tv  system to view the results    2.0952361346903294e+20
   fig  1 is a simplified block  diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the medical  electronics center of rockefeller institute    1.4100709714696337e+19
 by combining the  talents of a medical man    3.128927999000414e+16
 dr  aterman    3.128927999000414e+16
 a biophysicist    3.128927999000414e+16
 mr   berkely    3.128927999000414e+16
  and an electronics expert    3.128927999000414e+16
 dr  zworykin    3.128927999000414e+16
 this novel technique  has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding  life processes    1.6832114330517242e+23
   three different wavelengths of ultraviolet  radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the  three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources    1846723517832459.0
  these wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the  rotating mirror    447932110785.34985
 the specimen is magnified by the microscope    96414181982817.97
 instead  of the observereye the image orthicon in the  tv camera  does the  looking     7852462836289.296
 the microscope and orthicon are both selected  to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum    23344047615296.93
 which means that all  lenses must be quartz    728042272431935.9
   the video signal is amplified and then  switched    2.862576806655299e+18
 in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which  are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one twentieth of  a second only one wavelength    3.3589497156026944e+17
 corresponding to red    3.3589497156026944e+17
 or blue    3.3589497156026944e+17
 is  seen    3.3589497156026944e+17
 because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source  to another    4.074175918302075e+17
 the lights are switched by a commutator like assembly rotated  by a synchronous motor    1.317316100691024e+18
 this assembly also supplies a 20  cps  switching gate for the electronics circuitry    8741694668631112.0
  this is the same system  as was used in the field sequential color  tv system which preceded  the present simultaneous system    1.4157976511880208e+17
 three separate amplifiers then  drive a 21 inch tricolor tube    1.8875344115835154e+19
 the result is a color picture of the  specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet  wavelengths    90962936867233.7
   many of the cells and microorganisms which  are transparent to visible light    106947461593255.61
 absorb or reflect the much shorter  wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum    84456619727.92786
 different parts of these cells  sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often  possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color    673415270698200.2
  where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows  or nothing at all    2.4620489102974665e+19
 ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation  into a color  tv picture reveal a wealth of detail    1.182207130693401e+23
   at the  present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is  primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it    3.385359839981708e+19
    breathing   electronically analyzed   the medical title of  lobar ventilation  in man  by drs  c  j  martin and a  c  young    5787821050070.948
 covers  a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics  to the study of the respiratory process    6114.32638019793
 at the university  of washington medical school    64610519931.63433
 the electronics group has developed  the  respiratory gas analyzer  shown in fig  3    66332116661822.85
 this unit    66332116661822.85
  affectionately dubbed  the monster     66332116661822.85
 can be wheeled to any convenient  location and provides a wealth of information about the patient breathing    943848338381.354
   in the lower center rack an 8 channel recorder  indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper  and lower lobes of one lung    9399383641090078.0
 the total volume of inhalation per breath    135029998683275.45
  the flow of air from both lobes    67405049510398.305
 and the pressure of the two lobes  with respect to each other    3.31293626416963e+17
 usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece  while walking a treadmill    2.3624752210609766e+22
 standing still    2.3624752210609766e+22
 or in some other medically  significant position    3.814879579149417e+17
 from the resulting data the doctor can determine  lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail    1.1161372687577832e+18
    heart measuring  techniques   the original electrocardiograph primarily  indicates irregularities in the heartbeat    6241019423451853.0
 but todaytechniques allow  exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta    1213364474645.6506
 dimensioning  of the heart and its chambers    89453044250.94218
 and a much more detailed study of  each heartbeat    4.34536448885725e+20
 for many of these measurements the chest must be opened    436978326317695.7
  but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed    285540227.2332014
  a group of researchers at the university of washington have given  a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques    3.385638073922531e+20
 one simple  method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber  tube    3.756953030415472e+16
 filled with mercury    3.756953030415472e+16
 around the heart and record the change  in resistance as the tube is stretched    399374927079077.3
 a balanced resistance bridge  and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed    81482198508547.55
  sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing  small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel  and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy    4.070727555238639e+19
 the travel  time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes  about 16   msec  to traverse 25 mm  of tissue    1.1728190261732154e+17
 a sonar or radar type  of pulse generator and time delay measuring system is required for  body tissue evaluation    8.958493774999692e+20
 in addition to the heart and aorta    1535708595095996.5
 successful  measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique    2.318975372755848e+18
  the doppler effect    2.318975372755848e+18
 using ultrasonic signals    2.318975372755848e+18
 can be employed to  measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel    2102264962082249.2
  a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining  the effective power of the heart itself    1313518690443.637
 it uses both an ultrasonic  dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor  inserted into the bloodstream    2.866047057615062e+18
 the latter measures the heat carried  away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood  flow    16360714788.329302
 it is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer    829728202288550.5
 mounted  at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heartleft  ventricle    8.874941825555692e+20
 to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself    2.5699430891228004e+20
 this pressure  measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning  measurement is made    5170552785482127.0
 a simplified version of the instrumentation  for this procedure is shown in fig  2    6.199542809307273e+20
 outputs of the two  systems are measured by a pulse timing circuit and a resistance bridge    3.654870649661165e+17
  followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder    1.7794478925471452e+16
  from this doctors can read heart rate    8.327435441498491e+18
 change in diameter    8.327435441498491e+18
  and effective heart power    8.327435441498491e+18
    radio transmitter pills   several  years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule  which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal  pressure data to external receivers    6.919257898931099e+17
 this original capsule contained  a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm  in  diameter    7.03216427227206e+20
 battery life limited the use of this  pill  to about 8  to 30 hours maximum    1378842406208541.0
   a refinement of this technique has been described  by drs  zworykin and farrar and mr  berkely of the medical  electronics center of the rockefeller institute    2425389812569145.0
 in this  novel arrangement the  pill  is much smaller and contains only a resonant  circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure sensing  transducer    5.143191369979998e+19
 as shown in fig  4    5.143191369979998e+19
 an external antenna is placed over  or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400 kc   bursts    1774331003197597.5
 the energy received by the  pill  causes the resonant  circuit to  ring  on after the burst and this  ringing  takes  place at the resonant frequency of the  pill     143265858646.7546
 these frequencies  are amplified and detected by the  fm receiver after each burst  of transmitted energy and    4260878342880956.5
 after the  pill  has been calibrated    147345745269211.1
  precise internal pressure indications can be obtained    8.150897309903083e+21
   one of  the advantages of this method is that the  pill  can remain in the  patient for several days    64019189299521.61
 permitting observation under natural conditions    64019189299521.61
  applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are  planned for future experiments    1.202047225819687e+19
    sonar in medical research   one  of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine  detection is in the exploration of the human body    6606038218436.881
 our readers  are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent  out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects    2222723368005.231
 various  methods of pulsing    2222723368005.231
 and displaying these sound waves are used  to detect submarines    1.764106495272368e+22
 map ocean floors    1.764106495272368e+22
 and even communicate under water    1.764106495272368e+22
  in medicine the frequencies are much higher    183688088422884.66
 transducers and the  sonar beams themselves are much smaller    1527220553673.7925
 and different scanning techniques  may be used    5.220372110883489e+21
 but the principles involved are the same as in sonar    23094555756659.414
  because the body contains so much liquid    3161024103360690.0
 transmission of  ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels    3.0015952973885097e+18
  bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic  signals    744640581004716.4
 based on this phenomenon    744640581004716.4
 a number of investigators have used  this method to  look through  human organs    1.1298700642559558e+18
 a good example of  the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers  presented by dr  g  baum who has explored the human eye    8719152646880759.0
 he  can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate  blindness due to glaucoma    1.0740942078201153e+20
 the method used to scan the eye ultrasonically  is illustrated in fig  6    4.846074798661745e+20
 the transducer is coupled to the  body through a water bath    4.3341740882764484e+20
 not shown    4.3341740882764484e+20
 for display    4.3341740882764484e+20
 dr  baum uses  a portion of an   f    1223642423824051.0
 an airborne radar indicator    1223642423824051.0
 and then photographs  the screen to obtain a permanent record    2174064287053104.2
   a typical  sonogram   of a human eye    1.0185816847885838e+17
 together with a description of the anatomical  parts    262081408632.9583
 is shown in fig  5    262081408632.9583
 the frequency used for these experiments  is 15 mc  and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy  lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter    5.351514573657208e+16
  the transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan    2.380397218076066e+17
 just like  a radar antenna    2.380397218076066e+17
 while the entire transducer structure is moved over a  90 degree arc in front of the eye to  look into  all corners    1.7161683482823416e+18
  the total  picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector  scans over the entire 90 degree rotation period    363844748082733.44
   drs   howry  and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied  the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have  obtained extremely good results    1.6128915722711631e+18
 by submerging the patient in a tub  and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on    1.2175757024092906e+16
 they have been  able to get cross section views of the neck    25364516174.22389
 as shown in fig  7    25364516174.22389
 as  well as many other hitherto impossible insights    1.4022623526922046e+17
 as mentioned before    1.4022623526922046e+17

 he was born in the small danish town of rudkoebing on  the island of langeland in the south central part of denmark on august  14    8485540924730.997
 his father soeren was the village apothecary whose slender  income made it difficult to feed his family    10738307662266.965

    ferment of scientific  activity   hanstudent days were at a time when europe  was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in america  and in france    8.797644395290328e+23
 germany and italy were rising from divisive nationalisms  and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the  continent    9.865284444822053e+20
   the new century opened with oersted beginning  his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen  and as lecturer at the university    6.396614135657677e+19
 he was stirred by the announcement  of volta discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied  the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis    10970656142690.797
 the following  year he devoted to the customary  wanderjahr     1.6704381298252208e+19
 traveling in  germany    1.6704381298252208e+19
 and the netherlands    1.6704381298252208e+19
 meeting the philosophers schelling    1.6704381298252208e+19
 and tieck    1.6704381298252208e+19
 he also met count rumford  born benjamin  thompson in woburn    5.957952112844792e+16
 mass   who was then serving the elector  of bavaria    4.569129746788614e+16
 and the physicist ritter    4.569129746788614e+16
 these were oerstedmain  contacts in science    4.569129746788614e+16
   from go ttingen  1801  where he stayed  for 10 days    2.446600074274644e+17
 he wrote    2.446600074274644e+17
  the first question asked everywhere is  about galvanism    5.734978841850107e+19
 as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass  tubes i have invented    13548105583070.428
 i have had quite a small one made here of  four glass  tubes  in copenhagen i used 30  and intend to carry it with me     4700735224246.001
  oersted joined ritter at jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks    3.459387456863759e+17
 continuing  their correspondence after he left    3.460701302163974e+22
 with ritter he was exposed  to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host fertile but disorganized mind    1.118461402022333e+21
 oersted remodeled ritternotes  into an essay in french which was submitted to the institut de france  for its annual prize of 3    1.9000461891843114e+17
000 francs    1.9000461891843114e+17
 the sound discoveries of  this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize  was never awarded to him    1.213561909295103e+21
 in may    1.213561909295103e+21
 in another flight  of fancy    1.213561909295103e+21
 wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy    5.073934193241341e+18
  he related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and  indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided  with the years of important electrical discoveries    39428872874122.26
 1745 corresponded  to the invention of the  leiden  jar by kleist    3113831837921546.0
 1764  that of the electrophorus by wilcke    47846891437.45841
 1782 produced the condenser of  volta    53886313711540.13
 and 1801 the voltaic pile    53886313711540.13
 ritter proceeded    53886313711540.13
  you now emerge  into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820    6354752398600.677
 you will have  to reckon    6354752398600.677
 this we might well witness     6354752398600.677
 ritter died in 1810 and  oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of  it    1958700760140.979
   in 1803 oersted returned to copenhagen and applied for  the universitychair in physics but was rejected because he was probably  considered more a philosopher than a physicist    4.623091710237072e+18
 he continued  experimenting and lecturing    4.623091710237072e+18
 publishing the results of his experiments  in german and danish periodicals    1.2268729317447393e+18
 in 1806 his ambition was  realized and he became professor of physics at the copenhagen university    30667425838955.152
  though not realizing full professorship  ordinarius  until 1817    1.8203081617311125e+21
  during oerstedattendance at the university    1.8203081617311125e+21
 it was poorly  equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences    1.6482537520840614e+18
  he was    1.6482537520840614e+18
 fortunate in his contact with prof  j  g   l  manthey  1769 1842     177651569183.54276
 teacher of chemistry    177651569183.54276
 in addition to  his academic chair    1.4596554650471451e+23
 was  also proprietor of the  lion pharmacy  in  copenhagen where oersted assisted him    3.4283374276011565e+19
 manthey maintained a valuable  collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at oersted disposal during and after his graduation    1.2918731041700068e+18
 in 1800    1.2918731041700068e+18
 manthey went  abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion pharmacy    4981822832.8385935
 in  february 1801    4981822832.8385935
 oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus  and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates  of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates  of zinc and lead    657306647012.6864
 in the following year    657306647012.6864
 simultaneously  with davy    657306647012.6864
 discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic  battery more than did salts    2703925922088389.5
 eager as he was to pursue this promising  line    3.571990294341932e+18
 he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy  and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university  that he could devote only sunday afternoons to  galvanizing     8.966175523569112e+17
  he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and  thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood    6.552816537441619e+21
 the  university was the only one in denmark and the status of professor  represented the upper social level    208089866734.48065
 his broad interest in literary    208089866734.48065
  and philosophical movements opened many doors to him    4.6595734434356116e+24
 his friends  were numerous and their ties to him were strong    6.726655570001966e+16
   the years  1812 and 1813 saw him in germany and france again    1.8686377901446781e+18
 but on this  visit to berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his  first journey    18340442603756.48
 in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws  of nature in german and this was issued in french translation  paris    4.696306082018277e+18
  1813  under the title  recherches sur l identite des forces chimiques  et electriques    394598887891840.2
  a work held in very high esteem by the new  generation  of research chemists    139306159792374.06
 his interest in finding a relationship between  voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated    4977865533680.363
 chapter   8    4977865533680.363
 is entitled  on magnetism  and in it are included such  remarks as    1.7553321413414234e+20
  one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces  with the electrical forces    3.450280861781426e+16
 the great resemblance between electrical  and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their  laws necessarily would bring about this comparison    5.471106065807371e+17
 it is true    5.471106065807371e+17
 that  nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication    5.74438279670066e+17
  but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those  depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest  difference   h    5.308059151817026e+16
 the form of galvanic activity is halfway between  the magnetic form and the electrical form    33688394171612.09
 forces are more latent  than in electricity    4.194258490225016e+17
 and less than in magnetism   h    4.397840552861997e+18
 but in such  an important question    1.501117853566669e+19
 we would be satisfied if the judgment were that  the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity  and magnetism were only a difficulty    1.534325077335777e+20
 and not a thing which is  contrary to it   h    3.641820953928707e+20
 one could also add to these analogies that steel  loses its magnetism by heat    6.931653573569262e+16
 which proves that steel becomes a better  conductor through a rise in temperature    6.900956662178105e+19
 just as electrical bodies do    6.900956662178105e+19
  it is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature    253298476126167.25
 as  proven by bruckmann and coulomb    67980210075863.195
 by that    67980210075863.195
 one feels that magnetic  forces are as general as electrical forces    1.2698820160569595e+17
 an attempt should be made  to see if electricity    3.4935320372142344e+16
 in its most latent stage    3.4935320372142344e+16
 has any action on the  magnet as such     930647478537828.5
 his plan and intent were clearly charted    1.9360580787691012e+23
  oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and  political discussions    1.3955039875298561e+20
 in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment  as opposed to dogma    1843781410223828.0
 in another he held that the practice of science  was in fact an act of religious worship    998043791637193.4
 he continued as a popular  lecturer    9.819936874138948e+17
 he devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was  caused to glow by an electric current    7.288436554431498e+16
   in 1819 under royal command  he undertook a very successful geological expedition to bornholm    2.1438321014659988e+21
  one of the danish islands    2.1438321014659988e+21
 being one of three scientists in the expedition    20777057874770.117
  it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition    2235293.1597748045
  lauritz esmarch    2235293.1597748045
 that oersted succeeded in producing light  by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric  current was made to flow    1.7339346151958e+21
 together they also developed a new  form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of  copper    1784234338126119.2
 thereby producing stronger currents    1784234338126119.2
 esmarch was among those  who witnessed oerstedfirst demonstration of his discovery    1.336946962080342e+22
    discovery  of electromagnetism   the association between electric   both electrostatic and voltaic  forces and magnetic forces had been  recognized by investigators for many decades    4.471249478254227e+17
 electrical literature  contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and  had altered the polarity of compass needles    9997151586808.87
 in the late 1700 beccaria and van marum    788650997.7491657
 among others    788650997.7491657
 had magnetized iron by sending  an electrostatic charge through it    5.0202191389239616e+17
 beccaria had almost stumbled on  a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge  from a leyden jar was sent  transversally  through a piece  of watch spring steel making its ends magnetic    72619698702580.98
 the resulting magnetic  effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise    29769520436092.582
  the experiments of romagnosi and others have already been noted but  no one had determined the cause and effect relationship between these  two primary forces    7.3674019824615645e+19
 oerstedown earlier experiments were unimpressive    7.3674019824615645e+19
  possibly because he had    7.3674019824615645e+19
 like other experimenters    7.3674019824615645e+19
 laid the conducting  wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it    538265439992148.7
  the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains  ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the  university related that the first direct event that led to the publication  of oersteddiscovery occurred during a private lecture made  before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820    130686392972260.08
 at  this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel  to a magnetic needle    1.774817883525135e+17

  there are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle    1.705874569757239e+17
   1  fence line bunks  cattle eat from one side while feed  is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self unloading wagons    2405780765.4268227
   2  mechanized bunks  they sit within the feed lot    5.745646097426873e+19
 are filled  by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface    1.3710897404344581e+22
  3  special bunks   as discussed here    3.756314590699499e+20
 they permit cattle to eat from all sides    6.49354837601497e+16
 feed is  put in with an elevator    3.3844304153532824e+16
   several materials or combinations of  materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk    7.505780525247846e+16
 the selection  of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation    83294744823789.11
  cost of materials available locally    83294744823789.11
 and your own preference    83294744823789.11
 no  one material is best for all situations    1.9780559297498094e+21
 selecting bunks by economic  comparison is usually an individual problem    1.1638847409925438e+24
    fence line feeding    1.1638847409925438e+24
    animals eat only from one side    3.4818459788868464e+16
 so the fence line bunk must be twice  as long as the mechanical bunk    1.6870563395803635e+17
 these bunks also serve as a fence    1.8245243393585426e+18
  so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence    5.030028721978586e+17
 because  of their location    5.030028721978586e+17
 on the edge of the feed lot    38101474.80570949
 fence line bunks are  not in the way of mechanical manure removal    1018865695704965.2
 filling these bunks by  the same self unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the  wagons over more time and operations    6576950244492868.0
   all weather roads must  be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all  year    2.7631865241834586e+17
 this will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall    8.215184346679589e+18
  marketing in the new decade will be no picnic  for the sixties  will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you  have experienced in the last 20 25 yr     1075930308286.5142

 what competitive marketing problems will your  company face in the next 10 yr     1423337894340497.0
 based on our experience with  clients    1.8344717117327397e+22
 we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups   the market place itself    1.2917661276533524e+19
 marketing methods    1.2917661276533524e+19
 and marketing management    1.2917661276533524e+19
 problems in the market      greater price consciousness    1.3375258195985708e+16
   there has been an intensification of price consciousness in recent  years    3.253592380476451e+23
 there is every indication it will continue    6.266112205525395e+19
 wittingly  or unwittingly    6.266112205525395e+19
 price consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers    1.0768610411488496e+22
 and dealers    1.0768610411488496e+22
 despite generally good levels of  income    1.1995282525418008e+17
 we see greater price pressures than ever before  traveling  back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer    169775424535971.03
  here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy  will be on target    7.910611255237162e+20
   has the probable price situation in  your field been forecast as a basis for future planning    1.6479762697404056e+22
 have cost  studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might  be done if things get worse    8.307729804909754e+18
 have you actually checked out  not  just mentally tested  different selling approaches designed to counter  the price competition problem    1.650572730573602e+17
    increased customer sophistication    1.650572730573602e+17
   average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding  product and advertising claims    4.255049277801398e+21
 partly because of widespread criticism  of such assertions    1.5570356437572678e+16
 this problem can force a change in marketing approach  in many kinds of businesses    2.0582326332306493e+19
 have you examined this problem of  increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company    1.8780094944980895e+18
     greater demand for services    1.8780094944980895e+18
  need for service is here  to stay  and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the  sixties    101443488371.4846
 there are two reasons for this    2.3112566593666257e+19
 most products tend to  become more complex    51055165434623.69
 in a competitive market    51055165434623.69
 the customer  feels his weight and throws it around    2.0236735653615087e+21
    providing good customer  service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning  job as the original selling of the product     10036333356.700758
 too often it is  thought of at the last moment of new product introduction    2538651899.137917
   good  service starts with product design and planning    2.8398305896718695e+21
 many products seem  to be designed for a production economy    378169696029660.2
 not for a service one    378169696029660.2
 proper  follow through requires training your own sales organization    1.1693323974651903e+22
 and  your distributor organizations    1.1693323974651903e+22
 not only in the techniques but also  in good customer relations    1.056575498697655e+19
   have you assessed the importance of  service and given it proper attention    5.205815408448919e+18
    wider discretionary  choices for customers    5.205815408448919e+18
  in spending his money today    5.205815408448919e+18
 the consumer is  pulled in many directions    2.188515809812803e+19
 to the manufacturer of the more convenient type  product  the purchase of which can be switched    95779244944956.75
 or  put off entirely  the implications are important    5.7167465708546e+16
 your competition  is now proportionately greater  you are competing not only against manufacturers  in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers  of other appealing consumer products    3981199197671449.0
   many industry trade  associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share  of the consumerdollar being spent on their particular products    1.484972815825063e+21
  has your company thought through its strategy in this whole  discretionary  buying  area    4.409663601265403e+20
    geographic shift of customers    4.409663601265403e+20
   the trends have been in evidence for many years  population shifts  to the southwest and far west    283146554.5196171
 and from city to suburbs    283146554.5196171
 these shifts  will continue in the next 10 yr     724330834664154.4

  the controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior  designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought  clearly into focus one important difference of opinion    1.060516645327413e+20
 the architects  do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently  good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect  and that    10458411587.865456
 the interior designer is incapable of understanding  the architectural principles involved in planning the interior  of a building    1.0318431131056344e+16
   ordinary politeness may have militated against  this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance  in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables    6.070796399867113e+19
 workshops  or panel discussions  whatever they are called  on this subject  will recognize that the final    124782107572311.02
 boiled down crux of the matter is  education    9400206597.264502
   it is true that most architectural schools have five  year courses    6.213694493217264e+19
 some even have six or more    5.408733379914108e+18
 the element of public danger  which enters so largely into architectural certification    1.6884387039081923e+19
  would demand a prolonged study of structure    9712673076831482.0
 this would    9712673076831482.0
  lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior  designertraining    4.8282238082866246e+17
   we may then dismiss the time difference  between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior  design student as not having serious bearing on the subject    1.6429437403665127e+21
 the  real question that follows is  how are those four years used and what  is their value as training    5.548141735809608e+17
   the american institute of interior  designers has published a recommended course for designers and  a percentage layout of such a course    4.183348474020405e+16
 an examination of some forty  catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design    1.5448213577932675e+17
 for the most  part schools accredited by membership in the national association of  schools of art    293008640968.2737
 and a further  on the spot  inspection of a number  of schools    145744493565.41315
 show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations    4.811129176207286e+19
  one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum    1.6437378558569518e+18
 but  the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to  the four year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions    62962368894367.03
  the suggested course of the a i d  was based  on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to  curricular necessities    1.862011707567041e+20
 the four year provision limits this  to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated    2.4846374209759082e+17
  without comparing the relative merits of the two courses  architecture  versus interior design  let us examine the educational needs  of the interior designer    1272288614703.1138
   to begin with    1272288614703.1138
 what is an interior  designer    1272288614703.1138
  the dictionary of occupational titles  published  by the u  s  department of labor describes him as follows    3677722250227591.0
  plans and furnishes interiors of houses    1.0235639080950557e+19
 commercial and institutional  structures    1.0235639080950557e+19
 as well as set  decorations for motion picture arts and television    1.975323666020817e+24
 makes drawings and  plans of rooms showing placement of furniture    3.084058267302072e+16
 floor coverings    3.084058267302072e+16
 wall  decorations    3.084058267302072e+16
 and determines color schemes    3.084058267302072e+16
   furnishes complete  cost estimates for clients approval    1.395663701797309e+21
 makes necessary purchases    1.395663701797309e+21
 places  contracts    1.395663701797309e+21
 supervises construction    1.395663701797309e+21
 finishing and placement  of furniture    1.395663701797309e+21
 fixtures and other correlated furnishings    1.395663701797309e+21
 and follows  through to completion of project     4724216252704404.0
   in addition to this  the u  s  civil service bureau    283905710711099.1
 when examining applicants for  government positions as interior designers    1.1694820543404643e+22
 expects that  when various  needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them    2.0113355546816684e+18
  he must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture  of any craft materials needed in the furnishings     3.729377608352244e+17
   this  seems like a large order    1.3951930304461728e+19
 the interior designer    1.3951930304461728e+19
 must first be  an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and  plumbing and finance    10234145362031.777
 yet nobody will question the necessity of all this  and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice  it    1.4232767874269997e+17
 and further he must understand his obligation to the client  to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve  his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society    2.7328780563697274e+17
  few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording  of their curriculum    121075558186.65996
 it is in the quality of the teaching of all this  that a question may arise    4.485170763704933e+18
   the old established independent art  schools try their best to fulfill their obligations    1.656929323392765e+18
 yet even here  many a problem is presented    4.737699373426557e+18
6.418237282758303e+22
